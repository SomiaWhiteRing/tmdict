At the water’s edge, I found a lost item.

You’re normally an ideal Servant, so serious, so loyal, and kind.
So to misplace something is so unlike you.
The item looks like it’s dropped, rather than placed.

It shines as the waves splash over it.
It shines as it reflects the sun.
The light that reflects off it is gentle, not harsh.
It’s elegant and refined,
Truly, it’s something you would own.

Now let’s pick it up.
I have to follow you up the shore to return it to you.
I hope you’ll be relieved.

“Oh, there it is, my holy knuckle.
I mustn’t get it rusty, you know.
Hmm?
What is it?
Master, what are you writing?
A poem? That’s so wonderful.
Why are you hiding it? Master? Master?”
