The red silhouette tears through the night darkness…
Driving at dangerous speeds with no indication of stopping…

“You seem to be interested in this car. I may have already told you this, but it’s my Iron Maiden transformed. After all, summer and swimsuits can make anything possible.

By the way, I’ve named it Lola.
Why? Heh…curious as to why?
Well, it’s the name of one of the girls who entertained me in the past.
Her cute face got all twisted up, and her screams echoed like a scene from an opera…
Just thinking about it makes me shiver with excitement.

Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you jealous.
Don’t worry. There may be an opportunity for me to change the car’s name to your own… That is, if you can entertain me more than her…or rather, if you become one of my favorites…

And that’s why you’ll be showing me how cute you are tonight.
Even if you’re scared, I won’t let you close your eyes. Open your eyes properly and indulge yourself in my illusion and speed.
Are you ready? I’m going to floor it!”
