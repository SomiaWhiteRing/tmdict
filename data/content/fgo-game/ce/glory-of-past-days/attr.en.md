Let’s shoot, steal, eat, assault, and kill!
Have fun and live, have fun and die.
As we’re drowned in joy, pleasure, and happiness, as we’re screaming, begging for more, aye, let’s struggle and die!
There’s no need to mourn the dead and repent for our sins.
We’re pirates, and we’re destined for Davy Jones’ Locker.
So what’s there to worry?
Ahoy, let’s set sail with our beloved ship, and get killed with a smile on our faces!
