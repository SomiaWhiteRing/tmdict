Airgetlám, the shining silver arm.
It was originally the prosthetic arm of a god.
It was the replacement for the arm of Nuadha, the war god in Celtic mythology, which was lost in battle.
The arm was a god-forged armor created by Dian Cecht, the god of medicine, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship.

Of course, this was created as a replacement for Bedivere’s lost right arm, and is not Nuadha’s arm.
It is a temporary Noble Phantasm, made stronger by giving it the name of an item from legend.

Its true identity is – the sacred sword that he was never able to return.

In Chapter 6, the sacred sword was returned.
Thus, as a special exception, the right arm that he bears when he sits in the Throne of Heroes is not the sacred sword itself.

A virtual sacred sword.
This Noble Phantasm no longer wears away its user’s soul.
It is, in a sense, a new Noble Phantasm, activated by the bonds between Servant and Master.
