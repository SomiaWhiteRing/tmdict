Damn, this thing’s really falling apart.
It was made by collecting a few branches and fixing it up so I could use it as a substitute for Durendal.

I really don’t have much of an attachment to this weapon… Well, it can hardly be called a weapon because it’s just some old wooden sword.

But seeing it all beaten up like that…it’s kind of…sad.
Yeah, I guess it’s sad.
While I lived, I made a ton of mistakes. I caused a whole slew of messes, and I even did some immoral things too.

And so, had it not been in the hands of a brute like me, this sword probably wouldn’t be so battered.

Damn. I’m starting to get misty-eyed.
This thing doesn’t even have a conscience… It’s just some old wooden sword.

…But I’m impressed this thing held up for this long.
I was able to protect Master, all thanks to you.
