People might call this a second life, but I’m still the same me.
I kinda figured nothing would change…
But! That wasn’t the case at all!
Every day’s so heart-pounding, so tingly and throbly-feeling; it’s so fun and exciting… It’s the best!
But there’s not much I can offer you… I probably don’t have what you want.

After all, Servants can only find joy in destroying or hurting things.

Oh, but…

But I still want to give you a gift.
During New Year’s, Valentine’s Day, White Day, Halloween, Christmas…no matter what season or event, I just want to be by your side.

I may not be able to fulfill your desires, but being by your side is something I can do myself, and only I can do it!

So come on, let’s sing, let’s dance.
Let’s celebrate this wonderful day!
