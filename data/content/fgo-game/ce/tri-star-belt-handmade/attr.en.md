A return gift from Super Orion.

Various materials were combined to create this belt that also depicts the beautifully brilliant Tri-Star.

Wear it, and not only will your hunting skills improve, but also serves as a formidable Mystic Code. Orion apparently wanted to include some sort of transformation function when one inserted something into the three stars, but he gave up on that part.

â€¦However, a few of the inventors who got word of his intention seem to be excited to try their hand at making that a reality.
