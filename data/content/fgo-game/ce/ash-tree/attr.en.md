Yes indeed, the ash wood is superior material.
It is tenacious, elastic, and durable, which makes it the best type of lumber to forge spears.

Even in nations outside of mine, Greece in particular, utilized this wood for such weapons.

A spear is a tool that provides defenseless farmers with a way to arm themselves. It can also be a dangerous weapon that offers ordinary humans vicious strength.

But ultimately, it all depends on the will of the wielder. I pray that whoever takes hold of this will be someone with their heart in the right place. I hope that they are not someone who takes from others.

That is my humble wish, carved into this spear.
