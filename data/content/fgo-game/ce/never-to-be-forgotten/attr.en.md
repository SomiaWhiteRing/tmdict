Having lost my name…
Having lost my life…
I became nothing.

I may be an imitation of the living (original) me…
Even if I am merely a shadow of the dead (original) me…

There is one thing that I will never forget.

That moment when he protected me from everything that tried to hurt me… The freezing, numbing cold, the wicked fangs, the vicious claws…

Everything in that moment…
