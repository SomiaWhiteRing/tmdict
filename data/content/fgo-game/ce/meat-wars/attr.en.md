“Meat is good. It’s intelligence. The more you eat, your wild side gets agitated! Isn’t that right, Helena!?
Hey, you in the suit who can’t read the situation. I forgot you’re a vegan. Here, go chew on this onion. You know what they say, a weak body breeds weak intellect! Hahahahahahaha!”
“Heh. I see that not only your brain, but also your heart has become a ball of fur; you’ve become boorish as well, you commoner. I am indeed a vegetarian but, that’s only a principle and not absolute. Vegetables are absolutely necessary to bring out the best flavor in meat. Also, the combination of vegetables and meat is the more efficient way too, nutritionally speaking. Which reminds me. I am very interested in the brain stimulating component that’s hidden within Japanese wagyu beef. Ms. Blavatsky, would you be able to go get some from Japan using that flying saucer of yours?”
“There’s no such component like that. Wagyu beef simply is delicious. If you want to be smarter, eat fish. Fish!”

The scorching sun, the quietly rising smoke, and gentlemen who will never see eye-to-eye.

And so, a metallic field called the barbecue grill also becomes a battlefield, where another type of war is waged.
