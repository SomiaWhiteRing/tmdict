Crafted by the absolutely beautiful Tamamo Summer.

A summer cocktail of melted chocolates to enjoy by the beach.
It is said that it has ten times the sugar and elasticity of normal coffee and milk.
Delicious. But it’s dangerous.

“You only faint because it’s so delicious.
It’s not because it has alcohol! Not one bit!”

…At least, that’s what the splendid, white-hatted beauty tries to tell you.
