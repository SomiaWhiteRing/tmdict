When you open the door, they say you’ll see the ocean spread out before you on the other side.

The season is summer, and the sun’s shining down on the beaches, and there are blue skies and white clouds as far as the eye can see…
They say you can go there whenever you want.
…Yes, I think she read it in an old sci-fi novel.
Of course, she couldn’t read the whole thing, so she probably just skimmed through it…
For a girl who always stayed home in Chaldea, the idea of a door that connected somewhere must have seemed a wonderful fantasy.

…Yes, of course she understood that it wasn’t true.

A dream where if she opened all the doors in Chaldea, someday she would find one that took her to the sea she’d always wanted to visit.
I think it’s a wonderful dream. And I believe in it.
It’s my little sister’s dream, and if I don’t believe in it, who will?

So promise me, Master…
Once things settle down, let’s all go to the beach, okay?
I’m sure she’d love it… hehe.
