Dear Master of Earth,

Servant Space is full of shooting stars as usual. I am busy every day, solving crimes that threaten space order…whether it be galactic idol units forming, Dark Rounds reuniting, or evil goddesses of ancient civilizations resurrecting. But I’m fine.

I’m sorry. That’s a lie. I made all that up. I’m just a little tired because I’ve been busy working nonstop. But whenever I feel discouraged, I look at this picture to cheer myself up. I’ll never forget the time loop that was both never-ending and somehow over so quickly, or how super cool I looked during my tropical getaway.

Now that I’m on a long-term mission, I won’t be able to stop by Earth anytime soon, but everything should be back to normal by the time I visit again. And even if it hasn’t, I’ll solve that problem with brute force if I have to, so please don’t worry.

Until next time!
















P.S.
I hear that this is the third crisis humanity is facing. Just how many close calls with extinction does humanity have to have?
