Valentine’s Day chocolate from Lakshmi Bai.

A miraculous product made through sheer perseverance and only completed after a great many attempts. While it may be slightly misshapen, it’s still edible. Actually, it’s quite delicious. It proves that cooking skills really aren’t as important as putting one’s heart into it.

As she harbors a goddess of misfortune, she no doubt has a particularly keen understanding of luck’s role in the world.
