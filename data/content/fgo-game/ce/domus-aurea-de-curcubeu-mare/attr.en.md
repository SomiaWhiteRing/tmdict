“The theater comes from the sea…
 This is truly the high-class aurora…my golden theater!”

If the Roman bus is the best in space,
a tyrannical pool should be the Earth’s best.
The endless transparent Mediterranean sky and the summer sunlight create a beautiful arch over the new theater.

This is all for the lord (Master) of the summer…
A singing voice will (physically) blow away any catastrophes and obstacles, and bring about a glorious victory like no other.
