Valentine’s return gift from Houzouin Inshun.

A vegetarian Buddhist meal that is good for your digestion.
It will help to settle your stomach, which may not be feeling too great after all that chocolate.

It may not really hit the spot if you’re in a growth spurt, but as the saying goes, “all things in moderation.”

Once this meal helps your digestive system recover, the battle against chocolate awaits you once again.
