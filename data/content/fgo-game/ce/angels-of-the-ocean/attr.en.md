That’s right, angels. They’re angels. Okay, that’s really just a metaphor… But just accept the fact that they’re angels.
Nobody will blame you if you find yourself spellbound by their gracefulness when you swim along with them. They forge their path through the great oceans, traveling the world.

That’s right. That is why I have blessed them, and if necessary, I can give them my banner, since I don’t really need it now that I’m an Archer. Now, whether our enemy be a Kraken, sea serpent, Nessie, or even a megalodon, we’ll be ready!

Oh yes. While we’re at it, let’s see if we can borrow any unused weapons and armor from all the swimsuit Servants.

Eh? What is it, Master?
The dolphins might attack us?
Teehee, you’re such a worrywart, Master.
Unless the Holy Grail contaminates the sea to create some sort of Singularity, I am almost completely certain that would never happen!
