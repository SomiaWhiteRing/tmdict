Valentine’s return gift from Andersen.

Given to you because “it’s going to get old eventually.”
He claims that it’s an item that he no longer has use for because he switched to a tablet.
It’s just a used mouse.
This is a cheap mouse for children made by the Blue Bird Trading Co., which was sold through the big online shop “Ah! My zone!” But we’re a bit off-topic here.

There is a theory that the mouse brings good luck, and mice from the first lot manufactured are resold at an exorbitant price.
