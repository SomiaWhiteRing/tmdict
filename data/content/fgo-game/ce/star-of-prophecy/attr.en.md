I saw a shooting star when I was a boy.

It was fast and without hesitation.
Many friends witnessed this and were saddened by its ephemeral flash.
At that moment, a quiet assurance has struck my heart.

“My body will be like that star, burning away at a young age, and then disappear.”

Next thing I knew I was smiling.
I had accepted the fact even as a young boy, that all great warriors are destined to perish like that star.
