The monster was slain by the hero.

The terrible Gorgon took many lives in its wrath, but in the end, it was defeated.

Its body was put to many uses by gods and men.
Fatal poisons and elixirs to raise the dead were made from its blood vessels.
The blood that fell upon the desert turned to poisonous snakes.
Its head became a weapon of unmatched power.
The great hero Heracles said its hair could cause an army to rout if it was held up three times.
It’s said that generations later, Iskandar, the Conquering King, would add an image of the Gorgon’s head as an emblem to his own portrait.
The monster’s corpse granted unmatched power, and was used as a symbol for generations to come.

But what of the two Mystics that were born from the blood of the wound inflicted by the hero Perseus?
The Pegasus. The Chrysaor.
Were they gifts from the god of the sea, as the legend says?

Or perhaps…
Were they the last remnants of emotion of a monster that did not want others making use of its corpse?
