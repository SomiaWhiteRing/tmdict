Valentine’s chocolate from Minamoto-no-Raikou (Lancer).

A handmade chocolate ganache tart.
Its toppings are elegant, and it’s even presented on a fancy plate.

She bakes often.
When her Spirit Origin is in its Berserker state, she only makes Japanese sweets. The moment her Spirit Origin changed to a Lancer and she became Chaldea’s prefect, she claims she was compelled to make Western sweets.

“Teehee. I’ve given my feelings as the shadow prefect form, just for you.”

I…see?

As a side note, since the chocolate tart is not heart-shaped, it apparently does not pose an issue from a public morals standpoint.

“Heart-shaped things are not allowed. They are forbidden. Understood?”

Yes, ma’am.
