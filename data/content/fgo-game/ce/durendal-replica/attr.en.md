A return gift from Mandricardo.

A replica of Durendal. It may be a replica, but it’s still well-made. A satisfying electronic sound plays when you swing it, and it feels like you’re wielding a really cool sword.

It’s the perfect gift that allows you, Paris, and Mandricardo to pretend like you’re Hektor.

Considering it’s made out of plastic, it’s quite durable, likely as a result of trying to mimic the sturdiness of the real Durendal.
