“Finally! There’s a troubling case calling our names!”

The time is Japan’s Taisho Period, and the world is at peace…
During his spring vacation, the great detective runs into a prudish officer with a scowl and a fledgling student who seems to always show up at crime scenes.

The three of them together makes the three stooges. The three amigos.
Strange cases are sure to follow whenever they are together.
