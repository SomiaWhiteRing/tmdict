Valentine’s chocolate from Ishtar (Rider).
Great, because it sounds like a martial arts move.

It appears that, at one of the tourist spots she visited during the summer race, she came across some snacks that she found herself liking. Ishtar used those snacks as inspiration when making this gift.
There are three flavors:
The red rice cake is spicy with a hint of chili pepper.
The caramel-flavored rice cake packs a punch of sweetness.
And the cool mint rice cake reminds you of summer.
Her plan is that the two of you share these, but…let’s see how that goes…
