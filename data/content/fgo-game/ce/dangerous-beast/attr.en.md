It’s said that on Halloween night, a terrifying wolf-girl stalks the halls of Chaldea.
Dangerous…
Oh, truly a dangerous beast…!

“By the way, what’s your opinion, Fou?”
“Fou. Foufoufoufoufou.”
(First, her belly’s great. She’s got a little more fat than usual, right? You should give me mad respect for not stopping her from eating too many dumplings. I have no comment about the destructive power of her breasts at this point. I was well aware of it already. But I was so surprised that my coat changed. Mash looks bustier when she’s not wearing a shirt…
It’s dangerous. Very dangerous. The overall color scheme isn’t quite my thing, but purple is the perfect color for Halloween. It’s noble, innocent, and lewd. Maybe we should make an extra class just for her, you know?)
“Hmm, I understand what you’re saying, but I don’t understand the way you think at all!”
