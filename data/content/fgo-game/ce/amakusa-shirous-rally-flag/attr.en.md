…From that point in battle, defeat was certain.
What is vital is to show your will to fight.
We are with God, death will be peaceful.
But still, I could not simply die.
I kept thinking I needed to save even a single life.

The victory of today is tied to the despair of tomorrow.
I understand that. I understand, but…
Hear me, our flag.
If they had ever committed a sin, it would be believing in me.
The sin of following my lead.
I gladly dedicate my life to You.
So please, I wish to know how to save them.
But, if You cannot save them, if at the end of this battle, You need their lives, I will abandon saving people, and vow to save humanity.
Both good and evil, weak and strong, I will show you and save all of them.

This is the story of a boy who gave up being a hero.
A story of how he wished to do so even as he understood the egotism of it.
