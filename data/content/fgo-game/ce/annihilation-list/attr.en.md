“One Saber, two Sabers… Sabers… Ah, we just got one more!”
On a late night in Chaldea, an eerie voice echoes.
Every time a new Saber shows up, the mysterious Servant chants a spell, or something like that, full of hatred and despise.
“It’s strange, I’ve been ambushing them night after night, but their numbers just keep increasing.”
Please, put yourself in the Master’s shoes, and imagine the trouble of having to keep calling other Servants to heal injuries.
“Well, nothing to be done about that.
Let’s continue the chant tonight as well!”
Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die, Sabers shall die…
If any Saber hears this chant, then either their shoelace will break or some insect will end up on their faces…
At least that’s what the girl wishes would happen.
