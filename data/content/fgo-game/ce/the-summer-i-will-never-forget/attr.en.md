I may have wandered through numerous worlds, but nothing was more delightful than that summer.
My journey may have met its end, but your travels are boundless.

Swords clashed, there was a general hustle and bustle, dice were thrown, cards were played, roulette wheels spun… What an event.
It was a whole new world for me, where we laughed together, we competed against each other, and we piled up numerous victories.
The selfish me and the dreaded end both were like a pale mirage under the sunshine.
It showed that an independent and displaced martial artist like myself can still dream like any other.
And yet, the burden these dreams put on is unnecessary for the path that I chose to take.
Let’s just say that this is a temporary caprice, and everything is bound to go back to normal.

…I shall keep these final moments concealed within my heart.
The blue sky, the scorching winds.
Summer memories I spent with you, as the flowering swords danced.
