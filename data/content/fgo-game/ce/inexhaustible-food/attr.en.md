I don’t need a famous blade. I don’t want a famous bow.
You can take your famous spear and use it to hang clothes out to dry.
But these… these, I want.
I want them more than anything in the world.

These bags exist only to make people happy.
Everyone can feel happy and full, and nobody has to be unhappy.

Of course, maybe some thugs who want the power in these bags will appear, but I can just take all three of them and run!
They look a little heavy, but that is the weight of happiness.
A hero is used to carrying heavy stuff, you see!
