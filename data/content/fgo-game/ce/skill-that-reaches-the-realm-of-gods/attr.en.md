In this world, you sometimes see people with unbelievable talents put forth unbelievable effort and demonstrate unbelievable skills.
It happens.

The Divine Spear, someone said.
There’s no such a thing, as someone else laughed.
Shuwen was interested in neither. All that existed for him was to work so that the next attack can be even sharper, even more magnificent.
There was no room for other people.
If there was, then it wouldn’t be called the realm of the divine.
Breathing, concentration, his steps…
What he put forth is a spear strike worthy of reaching the realm of the divine.
It was a sharp wind, only perceived by those sitting on the throne of gods, atop of the holy mountain.
