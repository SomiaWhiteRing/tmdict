The stars rise and fall in the heavens.

Three stars line up to form a belt.
Betelgeuse and Rigel make up your body.
The stars that are supposed to be light years away manage to shine in the celestial sky to represent you.

But even that’s not permanent. They only dazzle in the sky for a few short hours.

And, as with all human life, you rose and fell like the stars.

I think that’s so sad.
So much so that every day, I look forward to the coming night.

But…
You probably think that’s how things are supposed to be.

Orion. My love. You became a star…you became a Heroic Spirit…you became a Servant…and you reunited with me.

I may make another mistake. I may even try to destroy this world.

I certainly hope that won’t be the case…
But if that happens…

Please destroy me with your arrow. Do it alongside Master.

Okay. As long as we make that promise, I can feel at ease staying beside you forever.

As long as we understand that we can both kill each other, you and I can be equals.

So let’s look up at the stars today.
Let’s look at the starry sky that is…you—beautiful and dazzling.
