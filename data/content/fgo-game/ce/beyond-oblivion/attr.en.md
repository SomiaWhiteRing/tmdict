In a faraway land, the Demon King’s sword burns with destructive flame even today.

Although Nobunaga possessed many swords, not one saw any use once Nobunaga was reborn as the Demon King, replaced instead by an aberrant demon sword. Just like Demon King Nobunaga, it is a collection of various possibilities of Nobunagas. This sword is also an amalgam of all blades possessed by Nobunaga.

It’s said that the sword continues to burn in oblivion, still waiting for the Demon King’s return, standing upright for eternity.

“Its name? Brace yourselves! Since it’s a demonic sword that burns all to ash in the hands of the Demon King…it’s called the ‘Demon King Sword!’”

…Uh-oh, the sword fell over.
