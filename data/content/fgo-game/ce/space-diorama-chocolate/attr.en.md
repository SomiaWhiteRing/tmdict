Valentine’s Day chocolate from all the spacy Ishtars.

Maanna, Dark Maanna, and Bel Maanna…the coveted trio, all together in one place. It turned out this way because each of them tried to outdo the others, but ultimately they decided to take the opportunity to be put on display like a diorama.

Should one of the goddesses be left out, the only result could be a war in space between them all, so try not to mess with this thing. The only foreseeable future for this chocolate is for it to be treated as a sort of mysterious OOPArt in a distant Universe a few seasons in the future…
