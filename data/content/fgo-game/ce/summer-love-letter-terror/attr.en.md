Oh, Master! ♪
Eh, you’re asking me what these letters in the sand are?
Of course, it’s a beach love letter!
Hehehe! Now I’ve used the whole beach to express my love!
…I got a little tired by the last half so there are some weird letters mixed here and there, but that’s nothing in the face of my love, right Master?
Now take a look! Look! Look! ♪

Have you gazed upon it to your heart’s content?
Then you should know what the answer is.
So let’s say it at the same time… Three, two, one!

Love!
I!
You!

…The. Order. Is. Wrong!!
