Why hello there, Master.
Ah, you want to know about this painting? Well, it came to me that I should try putting pictures in my “Tale of Genji” to make it into a picture scroll.

Eh?
Pretty, you say?
Thank you very much.

Actually…
I based it off an existing picture scroll. It’s “The Tale of Genji Scroll of Takayoshi Genji.”

But I have changed the theme. I’m drawing chapter nine, Aoi. It’s a chapter that was not drawn in the Takayoshi Genji’s picture scroll. Oh yes, that’s right, it’s the same chapter actualized by my Noble Phantasm.

I seem to be doing this unconsciously, but I must really like this chapter…

Or it could be…that my very soul is engraved in this chapter.

Hehe… What do you think, Master?
