Welcome to my Halloween Cafe!

Well? What do you think?
Aren’t these decorations wonderful?
I realized something! Halloween is about to end, and the spotlight shifts to something else, but that doesn’t mean the hearts that love Halloween just disappear!

So I decided that I’d become Halloween myself!
No, I mean I just opened a cafe.
You can listen to idol songs, eat bright red stew, and enjoy all the candy you want!
For some reason, you’re the only customer that’s visited, but I can just start advertising little by little, right?

Anyway, Master, trick or treat!
Never forget how it feels to have fun, okay?♪
