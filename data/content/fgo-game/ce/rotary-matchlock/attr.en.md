The Demon King who obliterated the strongest cavalry brigade in the Warring States period.
Her battle has changed so many concepts of “War,” and brought revolution to the battlefield.
It takes time to reload, and the accuracy is questionable.
Guns will never be of value on the battlefield.
That was what everybody thought at the time.

“Then I just need to gather a whole bunch of them and fire away right?
…In waves.”

And today, the Demon King has obtained another innovation.
By the way, although the name is confusing, it’s a matchlock rifle modified by adding rifling to the barrel, and not a Gatling gun.

“What? There’s something like that? I-I want it!”
