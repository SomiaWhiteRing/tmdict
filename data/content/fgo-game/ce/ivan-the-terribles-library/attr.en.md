A library housing a collection of ancient wisdom, history, and secret arts. Its contents were collected from around the world, and the library holds a mountain of treasure that an archaeologist would gladly pay a fortune to see, and that a mage would gladly give their life to possess.

I wish to save humans…to pray for them…
I wish to lead a life full of love and knowledge.
In service of that wish, let us collect as much knowledge as possible.

At least, that was the Tsar’s motive, but…
