Valentine’s Day chocolate from Bradamante.

Hippogriffs that have been chibified…and turned into chocolates. So cute. The white feathers are made from white chocolate, while the darker areas use normal chocolate. That they so closely resemble Hippoplushies is either a coincidence, or perhaps inevitable.

Please take a big bite! …Or so Bradamante insists, but it might be difficult since they are so adorable.
