At the end of the day, neither fate nor duty can be changed much.

You remain yourself.
She remains herself.
Neither of you left your homes, and neither of you tarnished the other’s dignity.
But that is also why one smiles and finds it all so dazzling.
It was brief…a memory that flickered by in an instant.
And it turned into a thorn that pricked and hurt one’s heart.

Even if grape trees never bloom in the underworld…to me, you will always be a grape.
No matter how much time passes, this star still makes my heart yearn.
Even after I disappear, this heat shall never dissipate.

When the Age of Gods has ended, souls no longer gather under the earth, and the mistress who stayed alone at her post has finally finished her role, bright sunshine will flood this wasteland.
The afterglow of a dazzling memory that I dreamed about so many times…of flowers blooming in the underworld.
And that is how I, carrying that feeling of happiness and content in my heart, disappeared like a flower.
