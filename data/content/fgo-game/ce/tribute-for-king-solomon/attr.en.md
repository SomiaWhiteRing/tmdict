The camels trudge along the road towards the holy city.
They don’t rush. And they never tire.

They are burned by heat of the hot sand dunes.
They bask in the cold moonlight.

There’s a scent of sandalwood, and the twinkling of mother-of-pearl workmanship.
There’s the valuable star-shaped murkiness of agate.

The seven great treasures are to be offered to the King.
The camels’ backs seem about to break under the weight.

What was gained from this journey?
Virtue? The knowledge belonging to the just king?

The true gift is actually the Queen’s heart.

There is no wealth that is more valuable than love.
There is no memory stronger than that of parting ways.

Life is full of encounters that may only happen once and then never again.
Just like the constellations Scorpius and Orion.

But how splendid tonight is.
For right now, we are with you, under this beautiful light.
