Valentine’s chocolate from the international superstar Nobbu.

A mysterious chocolate shaped like the giant flaming skeleton that appears behind Nobunaga. To this day, it’s unclear what that skeleton actually does. But really, does it even matter?

A magnificent product that elevates a certain other chocolate to greater heights. It’s kinda cool, but you still don’t really want it.

“Yeah! Is everyone Valentine-ing!?
I am the head of Valentines of the Warring States! Yep! It’s me! And this here’s my specially-made Chocolate Burns, It Can’t Be Helped! Only ten seconds left until it goes bad! Quick! Human life is but 50 years! Eat it while it’s still chocolate! It’s like a sweet dream! Now listen! The big spotlight is on the stage! For us! Let’s shred so loud it’ll reach Honnoji! Valentine’s Rock ’n’ Roll!!!”

…Oh, it melted.
