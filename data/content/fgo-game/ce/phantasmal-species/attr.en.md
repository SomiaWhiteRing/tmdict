A term generally referring to all the creatures found in myths and legends from around the world.
Their existence itself is a Mystic, and witnessing one of them is rare even in the world of mages.

For example, if the bulls that pull the Iskandar the King of Conquerorsâ€™ chariot are traced back to their origin, they are actually divine cattle gifted by the king of the gods, Zeus of Mount Olympus. The bulls are wrapped in lightning that represents the Authority of the god, and its thunderous cry was said to have shaken the sky.
