Until that day, war was an ordinary thing for the boy, and a source of amusement.
Swinging a sword or letting loose an arrow, it was all just fun for him.

But when Sita was abducted, and he faced the demon lord Ravanna in battle, at long last Rama knew the terror of war.

He did not fear death. But if he died, then those behind him, his comrades, his brother, and even his beloved Sita would all be lost.
He did not fear being wounded. But the thought of his men and brother throwing away their lives filled the depths of his heart with dread.

Battle is very frightening. But Rama never yielded or fled.
To kill or be killed, wound or be wounded.
He accepted it all and faced the battle.

That in itself is the nature of a hero.
To feel fear, yet press onward, shouting the names of those you love!
