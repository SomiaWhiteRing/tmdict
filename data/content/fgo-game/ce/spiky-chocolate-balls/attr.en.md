Valentine’s chocolate from Penthesilea.

Spiky chocolate balls best described as hard, painful…and delicious.

At the queen’s command, these chocolates were created in times of emergency…the sort of situations in which warriors are sure to find themselves at one time or another.

For example, if one gets stranded in a desert island teeming with Demonic Beasts.
Or if one is thrown into a gladiatorial arena where warriors from all ages and nations assemble.
Or when you suddenly confront a detestable Greek hero.

No matter the situation, or how unexpected it is, the calories and destructive power of these chocolates are sure to help you out.
As a side note, the pink part of the chocolates is strawberry flavored.
