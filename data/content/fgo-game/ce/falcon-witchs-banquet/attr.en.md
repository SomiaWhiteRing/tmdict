Horse? Oh, you mean “host.”
No problem. Leave all the party planning to me.
I’m glad you entrusted me, the Falcon Witch, with the task.
Now that I’ve been appointed for the job…even if it were my own funeral…I’ll make it a grand banquet where laughter will constantly fill the air.

After all, I’m pretty picky when it comes to food.
I’ll prepare all the best ingredients, ones that would be fit for an offering to Hecate.
And splendid wine that even Dionysus, the god of harvest, would be jealous of!
And we’ll have so many innocent maidens, even the god of shepherds and flocks, Pan would resurrect himself from the underworld…
…Eh? I don’t have to go that far?
Why?

No, no, that won’t do, Master!
One must give it their all for the sake of degradation!
Humans gained life to indulge themselves in banquets. That’s right, the joy of a banquet is what life is all about!
First, forget about titles and status, and throw obligations and duties into a waterfall or something.
There’s no need to think of tomorrow and no need to reflect back on the past.
Just relax and surrender yourself to me.

Forget about morning and night and just drown yourself in the delicacies and the pleasures of the flesh.
There’s no need to hesitate. Death is always right around the corner. Just enjoy the present.
You don’t need an invitation to this party.
Yep…just a spoonful of this barley drink kykeon…

Eh? You changed your mind?
You’re not putting me in charge? Aw, come on!
I’ll do it right! Hello?
Give me a chance!!!
