…I’m burning.

Yes.
I’m burning.
Yes.
With flames.
No, this isn’t a joke, not at all.
This is truly happening.
I am burning right now even as I am speaking to you.
Can’t you hear it, the sound of roaring flames?

My existence started with flame and ended with flame.
When I met Sigurd, when I killed Sigurd.
When my life started, when my life ended.
I was always engulfed in flames.

Before I knew it, I had become the flame itself.
You can see it, right?
The Blue Flame.
Mana Burst?
No, no.
This is the form of my overflowing feelings.
I may die, I may be killed, but this feeling will not perish.

If it looks like the flames are going out…
Well, they won’t.
I’m sure they’re just smoldering.
