A gift from Sitonai.

White chocolate delicately wrapped with a thin layer reminiscent of mochi. It melts in your mouth just like snow.

This delicacy was created in the simulator purely as data…or so one would think, but that’s far from the truth. Turns out that Sitonai was making it in reality so that she could give it out to other Heroic Spirits!

Now come on! Let’s go and give these gifts with her!
