She had no name.
No history.
She never had any obligations, any needs, any fate of her own.
The only reason she met her end was because she was there… She was merely caught amidst it all.

She held no grudges.
Her hatred, gone.
I know…
I realize she had no need for those emotions.

And that’s exactly why I’m sad.
There is nobody who will remember her name…not even herself.

When she held my hand, did she really feel salvation?
Through my hand, did her regrets and resentment really disappear?

There will probably be no real answer to those questions.
For eternity…forever…
