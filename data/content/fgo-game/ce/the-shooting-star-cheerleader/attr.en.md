I don’t know anything about your universe, but take a look at THIS me!
I’m not really a cool hero or anything, and I’m just a thrill-seeking traveler who can’t stay in one place!
That’s why I don’t have a home or any money!
The only things I actually have are countless memories and the feelings of longing that sting my heart whenever I set out on a journey.
But this time around, I’m going to stay in one place a bit longer than usual☆
’Cause this place is so much fun!
Since you don’t seem to be bothered by my catastrophe nickname, I’m gonna root for you with everything I’ve got! Yeah!
