Valentine’s chocolate from Abigail.

A chocolate key (freshly made).
A chocolate confection handmade by Abigail Williams. A simple, key-shaped chocolate. After the chocolate was released from its mold through warm water, it was decorated with almonds, silver dragees, edible silver foil, and powdered sugar. It’s delicate, so be careful when handling it. A few strands of Cat’s hair got mixed in, since she helped make it.
