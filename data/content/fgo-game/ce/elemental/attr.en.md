Elemental.
Right, yes.
It refers to a supernatural being that symbolizes the four major elements.
That’s how you put it in words.
But when I speak of it, it means something different.

Artificial spirits aggregating the powers of each element’s power.
Those are the elementals that I command.
They overcome reality, but are not Phantasmals.
Earth, water, fire, air, and ether.
They are elemental spirits of the five great elements.

You can use them as pools of concentrated magical energy, or for attack and defense.
For me, yes, they are also of use as materials for research and catalysts for ritual spells.

Well.
Now, please have a look.
The brightness of the elements that make up this world…
Perhaps this mystery may one day lead us to the Root.
