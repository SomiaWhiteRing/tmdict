Valentine’s Day chocolate from Yu Mei-ren.

A handmade gift fashioned by Yu Mei-ren after she conducted extensive research about Valentine’s Day. They’re extravagant chocolates―if only in appearance. Her research led her to conclude that chocolate is a sweet, dark-colored confection, which is an idea she took and ran with. She used solidified black sesame paste instead of cacao. As long as you think of it as a pastryless moon cake, it should be quite tasty.

“Hmph. This is what you call worldly wisdom. Impressed, yes? Then starting tomorrow, you should be twice as reverent toward me.”
