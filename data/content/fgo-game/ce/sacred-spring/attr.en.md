The center of the world, its chosen heroine, the ruler of all.
Yes, that’s right… I am Medb.
Medb, Queen of Connacht.

Lovers, comrades, children, even kings.
All belong to me.
All shall be charmed by me.
All shall love me. Then be taken by me.

Love me, love me, and keep loving me.
I shall take and take and keep on taking.
There’s no use resisting me.
Because you want to be ruled by me, don’t you?

Then beg me.
Rather than the Holy Grail, cling to me as you would a holy spring.
If I’m inclined to… I may do something nice for you.
