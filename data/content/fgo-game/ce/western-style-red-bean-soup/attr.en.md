Valentine’s chocolate from Mochizuki Chiyome.

Rice ball dumplings and red beans mixed with hot chocolate.
At first glance, it looks like a zenzai (red bean soup).

She wasn’t confident in its taste, but it is actually quite good.
Even the kitchen Servants approve.

After the warm chocolate melts away all the exhaustion of the day, please let her know what you think of her chocolate.
Your praise is sure to please her.
