Ah, so it came again this year. While it is merely a promise that was made long ago, it makes me happy. Though city scenery may change as time passes, spring in the mountains never does.

There were many things to rejoice for. Many memories made. The days and months passed, and seasons changed. Through many meetings and partings, people grow and age. Innocent lies and the kindness that can turn lies into truths now seem to be a dream of the past. The more wrinkles that form on the hand, the more the fairy tale of yesteryear is forgotten.

But even if such memories are not revisited, the blossoms we saw that day remain within our hearts.

To be able to craft such a memory with you is a joy beyond measure for this nameless slave girl.

May your life be blessed with happiness. Even if your memory of this fairy tale is lost, Beni will always be at your side.
