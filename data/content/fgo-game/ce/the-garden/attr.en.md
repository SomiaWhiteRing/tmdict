The promised place.
Is it the golden field that he was meant to reach?
Or is it the hill of corpses where a bloody battle took place?
Or is it perhaps the slumbering forest where he decided to return the sacred sword?

No. It is none of those.

The moment he decided to become a knight instead of a king, his promised place was determined.
In other wordsâ€¦

An inheritance of love.
A garden bathed in gentle moonlight.
