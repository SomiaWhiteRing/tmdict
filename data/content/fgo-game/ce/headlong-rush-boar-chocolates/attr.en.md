Valentine’s Day chocolate from Atalante Alter.

It’s shaped like the Demonic Beast, the Calydonian Boar, and it’s really quite well-made. The pink part is made with strawberry-flavored chocolate. It’s made for children, so it’s on the sweeter side.

“Well, you know…I made this thinking you were sick of apples. I’d appreciate it if you’d share with the children.”
