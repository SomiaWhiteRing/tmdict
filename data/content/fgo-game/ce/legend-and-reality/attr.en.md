According to legend, the word “impossible” does not exist in Napoleon’s dictionary.

According to some records, Napoleon loved to smoke Spanish cigars.

He denies neither of these things.

He may deflect with a joke if the topic of his appearance comes up, but he never denies the legends, anecdotes, and records about him.

He simply laughs and says, “At least they’re all true of me now.”

The correlation between legend and reality, or rather their contradictions, can be applied not just to him, but to all Heroic Spirits. Should that be the case, what features make Napoleon unique?

Act like you accept them all…legends, anecdotes, and all records.
