Valentine’s Day chocolate from Carmilla (Rider).

It melts so quickly… A bloody sweet…

It is offered…wholeheartedly…

A super high-end chocolate encased in a classy, ornate case reminiscent of a jewelry box. The wine-red lipsticklike hue and moderate bitterness combine with the aroma of brandy to make a very mature gift. A thief’s calling card appears to be included, but it contains no message.

Of course not, because the chocolate itself expresses her intention to steal that which you hold most precious.
