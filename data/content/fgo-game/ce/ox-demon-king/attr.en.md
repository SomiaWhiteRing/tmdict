A king of demons as powerful as the great Monkey King.
Once the greatest amongst all immortals in the heavens.
Now, sheâ€™s a great and powerful demon. Her height exceeds the clouds and she can hurdle a hundred mountains with one leap.

Her True Name is the Ox-Demon King.

Yes, she is one raging bovine.
Especially in, ah, profile.
