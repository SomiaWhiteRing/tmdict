“This is the final battle.
Once again, we’ll swoop in to save the world in a blaze of glory!”

In the near future, the earth is threatened by unknown life-forms.
The only weapons with the power to fight back, all-purpose bipedal exo-suits, have been entrusted to the group of wandering space warriors called the “Chivalric Order of Fianna.”
…And these are their ace pilots.

Humanity’s future is on the line. The final assault begins now.
