A mysterious substance that is treasured in a certain galaxy.
It’s imbued with strange energy that can power up Craft Essences.
At times it can be solid, and at others it can be malleable.
It seems cold and warm at the same time.
It’s superb fuel, and it is said that it can even build space ships.
“It’s like the dollar store of space, woof!”

The cat is well-versed.
