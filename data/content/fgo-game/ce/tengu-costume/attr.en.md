In the western mountains, someone was bullying innocent wildlife. Hearing the animal’s cry for help, the great tengu of Kurama leaps into action!

“Why you insolent human…throwing rocks at a helpless animal. Have you no shame!? Take that…tengu stone! See how you like a taste of your own medicine!”

“Ahahaha! See that, Tanukichi? Look at the way that human flees so pathetically! And now they’re paralyzed with fear! They’re never going to think of hurting animals ever again!”

In the eastern mountains, someone was cutting down a helpless tree. Hearing the tree’s soundless cry, the great tengu of Kurama leaps into action!

“Those who do not cherish nature have no right to enter this mountain. Take that…great leafy whirlwind!”

“Pffft! I didn’t think they would fall into the river in just their underwear! Oooh, I’m laughing so hard! My sides! Ah, Risuzou…don’t you worry. I’ve avenged your house. Now let’s go look for a new home for you!”

“Ahhh, a hard day’s work of punishing others. Hm? What’s wrong, Tanukichi and Risuzou? Behind me? What’s behind me? M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-master! It’s not what you think! I wasn’t doing anything bad… I was just punishing those scoundrels who were harming the mountain… And that’s why I had no choice but to sneak off with your dress and fan… It’s not my fault―”

Play is truly the best form of training.

But sometimes, one needs a bit of discipline (punishment) that may not be quite so fun…
