I am Alter Ego, Majin Okita Souji Alternative!

Now that I hear it out loud, that’s kind of long. How about Majin Okita Souji… No, how about Majin Okita? Hmmm…Okita Souji (Alter)… No, that’s too formal. Maybe I’ll make it more friendly sounding and go by Majin Sa―Er, I forgot I was an Alter Ego.

Oh hey, it’s my favorite food, oden. I prefer not to put spicy mustard on chikuwabu because the spiciness stings my eyes. You know, the spiciness.

By the way, go ahead and use this to level up that old man who gives you more than three quarters of your NP.
