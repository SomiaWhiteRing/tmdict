Valentine’s chocolate from Scheherazade.

A rolled chocolate cake in the shape of a scroll.
Its sweet taste is like a refined story that is sure to melt you in more ways than one.

Her only wish was always to live another day, but this gift is evidence of a new kind of wish she holds.
…Or at least, it could be.
