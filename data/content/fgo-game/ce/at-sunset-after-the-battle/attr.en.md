The battle is over. The gentle summer sunset slowly envelops the heart of the princess (me).
Now, let’s lay down our arms. Let’s weave a love story together.
Everyone shall get along, holding hands in a circle to dance and sing and pray for world peace.

…But know this: once one battle is over, another one awaits, s’il vous plaît.
TASUKETE, MAAAH-CHAN!

At least the storyboard’s done this time.
The main heroine will be Kiyo-yo, the sub heroine is Kiyo-yo, and the background female student Kiyo-yo admiring the protagonist Ma-chan, and it’ll be super full of Kiyo-yos… This will be a brilliant school days parody story (original work by Kiyo-yo)!!!

…Maybe I’ll stealthily change all the character faces to be the princess (me)…
