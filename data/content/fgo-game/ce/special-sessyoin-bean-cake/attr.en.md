Valentine’s chocolate from Sessyoin Kiara.

High end Japanese bean cakes. For some reason, they emit a sense of godliness.
Normally, an indolent, self-indulgent woman like her would not cook in the first place, but the Devilish Bodhisattva in her can demonstrate extreme talent when needed. The dish itself tastes like the very nectar of the heavens themselves.

One taste of it, and the tongue grows parched, the eyes melt, and after the psyche is tormented by its exquisite taste, the sense of being a storm-tossed vessel overwhelms the hapless fool who consumed it.
Eat but one, and you may walk the path of man.
Reach for the second, and who can fathom what may happen…

Your perilous destination is Valentine’s Day.
Now then, what will become of this Japanese confection?
