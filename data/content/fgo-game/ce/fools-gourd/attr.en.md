A return gift from Oda Kippoushi.

A gourd that Kippoushi carried around on their hip when they were considered nothing more than a laughing stock by the other daimyo, and bore the moniker of the Fool of Owari. There’s no particular history behind it; it’s just an ordinary black gourd.

During this time, Nobunaga was noted to wear eccentric clothing while hanging around the castle town. Those who derided them as a fool, those who realized their actual intent…it’s unclear what Nobunaga’s true objective was, but the Fool of Owari’s legend began here.

Wahahahaha! Now you are the Fool of Chaldea!
