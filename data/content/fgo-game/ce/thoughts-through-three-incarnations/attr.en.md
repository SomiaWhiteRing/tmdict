A travelling monk left Kiso and reached Awazugahara, near Lake Biwa.
There was a shrine there.
A woman was visiting.
She was beautiful, but she wept uncontrollably.

The woman was a spirit, and disappeared when the evening bell rang.
When the monk began to chant a sutra, something else materialized.

A dignified woman warrior in full armor appeared.

She began to speak of her regret, her sorrow, and her feelings for her lord, who was also her husband.
The woman never once abandoned her love for her late husband, not even in death.

In the Noh play, after that, the female warrior… “I,” would ask the monk to grant rest to my attachment and my soul.

What’s that?
How did it actually go, you ask?

Hee hee. I beg that you let me keep that part a secret.
But if I were to reveal one thing…I can tell you that I vividly remember what happened then.
