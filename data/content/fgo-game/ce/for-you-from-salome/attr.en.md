Valentine’s Day chocolate from Salome.

Tons of skull-shaped chocolates stacked on top of the silver platter replica that Salome carries. They’re sweet chocolate that melts whenever you pop one into your mouth. There is absolutely no sort of curse imbued into them. At least…there shouldn’t be. For some reason, you feel your heart flutter whenever you look at the chocolates, though.

Perhaps they were molded using some sort of magical energy. They do melt when they’re left out in room temperature, so you’ll need to eat them as soon as possible. All of them.
