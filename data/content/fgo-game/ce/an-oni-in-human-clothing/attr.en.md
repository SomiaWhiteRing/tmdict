When the seasons change, the oni come out.

The left hand holds a masu wooden box for alcohol. The right hand holds beans.
Throw the beans and chant, “Oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi” (Out with the oni, in with good fortune).
This event has been practiced yearly since ancient times to ward off demons.

Now then…who will be the one to fall in ruin?
