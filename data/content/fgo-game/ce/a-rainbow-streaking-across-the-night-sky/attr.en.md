Santa Claus and her sheep run through the powdery snow.
A rainbow streaks across the night sky, providing gentle illumination.
This is not a sign of imminent disaster. It is more like a shooting star that one makes a wish upon.
The nomadic princess who was born on the surface world is excited by her given role even though it lasts only for one night.
Her head might be a bit warm from the fever, but she remains herself, and she is genuinely beaming.

“…Yes, presents are good civilization.
Those who wish for one and those who deliver them both hope for the other person’s joy.
Anyone who gets in the way of this twinkling night shall suffer the Fluffy Master’s punishment.
By my Whip of God, that is. Ho ho ho! Can’t you see that I’m Santa!?”
