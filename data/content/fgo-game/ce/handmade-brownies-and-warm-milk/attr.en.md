Valentine’s Day chocolate from Europa.

Brownies stacked high on the divine consort’s favorite plate, with a glass of warm milk in a steaming cup. It’s one of the younger Servants’ favorite snack pairings. If they catch you eating it, be ready for them to flock around shouting about how unfair it is that you get it instead of them, and how tasty it looks.

The brownies are pressed flat and cut into perfect squares, and their moist, delicate texture is practically addictive. The nuts add just the slightest bit of crunchiness to round it all out.

“But do try not to eat too much, or you might spoil your dinner. If you like them, I will be happy to make more next time.”
