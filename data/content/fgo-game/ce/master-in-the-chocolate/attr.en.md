A forbidden Valentine’s Day chocolate from BB.

An exquisite chocolate shaped intricately and eerily similar to Luluhawa Island. It’s sweet…oh, it’s just so sweet. One could rightly say that it’s like a chocolate reality marble to melt the days away.

…Is the island made of chocolate?
…Or is the chocolate made of the island!?

You will never know, for in truth, you’ve been trapped inside it.

The vacation that keeps on repeating itself will never end, and there is nobody else who comes to visit the island. There’s no place to run… Not to the past, nor to the future…
