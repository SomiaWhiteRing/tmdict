Valentine’s return gift from a forest hunter.

This item was issued when the new lord started his post after the first lord of the town was defeated.
It seems like it’s some sort of commemorative item to Robin.
You can use it as a talisman or even sell it.

His relationship with the mysterious blue bird began here.
