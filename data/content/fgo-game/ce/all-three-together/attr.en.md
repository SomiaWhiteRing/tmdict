On the high mountain lies a Lotus Cave, and within the cave lie beautiful yet terrifying sisters.

Golden Horn wields a Noble Phantasm stolen from the vaults of Heaven.
Silver Horn is the master of three mountains: Sumeru, Emei, and Tai.
Bronze Horn is just being made to tag along.

Once you set foot on this mountain, there is no escape from the sisters.
