Valentine’s Day gift from Gareth.

A mountain of sweet, moist chocolate cupcakes. They were made for Brother Gawain, Lancelot, Mordred, Jekyll, and especially for Master. They were baked with so much heart, with hopes of everyone eating them and commenting how good they are.

Gareth secretly hopes that Brother Agravain will get a taste one day…
