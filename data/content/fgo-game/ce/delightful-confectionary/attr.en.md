Valentine’s Day chocolate from Sei Shounagon.

Inside the egg, there is a piece of paper that contains a single phrase: “Iwade omouzo.”

Though I speak not of it, I think of you.

This was a line that was once sent to a broken-hearted Shounagon during her lifetime. This phrase is so uplifting that it is almost a spell to lighten one’s heart.

Also, the chocolate itself just tastes normal.
