I don’t care what my weapon is.
As long as it’s easy to channel my magical energy into sufficient destructive power, that’s all that matters.
Screw “the creator’s passion.”
Weapons are just tools designed to make killing more efficient. Nothing more, nothing less.
Bearer’s pride? Don’t make me laugh.

It’s absolutely pathetic that someone couldn’t even kill without assigning some impressive reason for existing to their tool.

What, you got a problem with me?
Then pick up that gun and shoot me in the head.
That ought to shut me up!
