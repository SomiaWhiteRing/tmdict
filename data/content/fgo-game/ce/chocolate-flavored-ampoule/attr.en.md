Valentine’s Day chocolate from Nightingale Santa.

The terrifying medical Mystic Code, the Assault Medicine bullet, that was used as a weapon(?) by Florence Nightingale when she temporarily changed into the Santa Spirit Origin. However, this time it contains not the usual green medicine, but chocolate-colored medicine.

That’s right. It may be called Valentine’s Day chocolate, but it’s actually medicine.

Apparently this particular medicine is excellent against cavities, so there’s no need to worry about eating too much of it. Consider it a most fitting medicine for Valentine’s Day.
