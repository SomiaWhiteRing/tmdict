When the fog is thick at night, Jack the Ripper appears.
You can lock your door, close your windows, even hide under your sheets, but Jack will still slip through the keyhole to get you.
The disgusting sound of dripping blood, accompanied by the sight of dissected bowels.
Consciousness is fading away, soon you will die of despair.
Despite that, the last thing you hear before your death is…
“Mother”
and a strangely pure smile like that of an angel.
