Valentine’s gift from Sieg.

Since he received chocolates, he figured he needed to reciprocate, and asked around for advice. Getting a hint from the Seven Gods of Fortune, he drew a picture to put under a pillow for good luck. It was his very first attempt at drawing something, and he struggled a bit, but he did at least finish it.

“Hopefully this will help prevent you from having nightmares.
…And should I flag events under the nightmare removing category?”
