It’s sparkly, it makes one feel content, it’s fluffy, people hug the wearer with a big squeeeeeeze, and it’s a really, really happy thing.

That’s what it is to be a bride. I think I knew what they were even before I was born… I knew that any girl can transform into someone cute and be happy when she becomes a bride.

But everyone told me:
“You’ll never be a bride.”
“No world would accept you.”
“There’s no dress that would look good on you.”
And I agree.
After all, I couldn’t find anything that was made just for me.

“I see. Would you be able to wait ■ years?”
“I don’t know when it’ll be, but I promise…”

So with those promised words held in my heart, I returned to my cage, and many months and years passed by. Then, I awoke to a scene that almost seemed a continuation of my dream.

“Thanks for waiting. Sorry it took longer than expected.”

The person who smiled and said such kind words is now long gone, beyond the reach of time. But finally, I have become a cute bride…a bride who loves you so much.
