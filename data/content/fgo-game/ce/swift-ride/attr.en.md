Valentine’s return gift from [servantName 1100500].

He just wanted to run. He just wanted to dash through a wide, grassy field.
He did not care who rode upon him.
Did you feel a pleasant breeze pass through you?
Did you feel like your heart is soaring?
…Did you enjoy it?

Well, it doesn’t matter.
At least the gesture counts as a return gift for that intense and poignant sweet scent.

Honestly, it really doesn’t matter.
As long as the experience left a lasting impression on you, he will be proud, satisfied.
