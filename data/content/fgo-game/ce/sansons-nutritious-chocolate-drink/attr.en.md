Valentineâ€™s return gift from Charles-Henri Sanson.

Chocolate was popular in Paris back in the day as well, but it was also in high demand as a drink.
This is full of nutrients because it has egg yolks in it.
As a side note, it is said that Marie Antoinette took her bitter medicine by wrapping it in chocolate.
