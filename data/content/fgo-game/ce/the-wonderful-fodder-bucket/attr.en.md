Behold how they brightly shine!
A wonderful combination of carrots and fodder in a bucket…ah yes, there is no doubt this is the object lauded as the Holy Grail…
It’s truly beautiful….
Ah, so beautiful…beautiful…so delightful…delight…deli…delicious…
Neeegh! Bnnnrrrgh!
Bnnnrrgh!
Neeeigh!
Bnnnrrrgggh!
Brrrh! Brrrh…!

My apologies.
Allow me to try again.

Now come, my loving Master.
There’s no need to hold back.
Please take a bite from the glorious feed trough filled with carrots and fodder.
Oh? You do not care for fodder?
Then at least nibble on a carrot.
