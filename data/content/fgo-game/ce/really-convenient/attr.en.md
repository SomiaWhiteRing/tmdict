This is crazy. Super crazy. The difference in writing speed is way too much.
You can write three strokes to make a “K”!
Or you can just hit one key to type a “K”!
In other words, this is three times as fast! Or even faster!
Each time I hit a key my inspiration just keeps on growing! The ideas just keep pouring out, weaving into the next story. I am truly captivated by how good this feels!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! My writing speed indeed, has surpassed that of an Asura. No, I dare say it has even surpassed God himself!
Wait, the ky is actually broknnnnnnn!?
