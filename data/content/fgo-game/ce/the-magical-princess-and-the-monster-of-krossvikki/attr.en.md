A completely original fantasy story that follows the interaction between two protagonists from a faraway kingdom. One is a monster who was born from a war experiment. The other, a princess who, due to a witch’s curse, possessed lost magic and was held prisoner so she could become a secret weapon later in the war.

Ideas for the story’s conclusion ranged from the monster turning human once more to the two being separated forever, and so on… But in the end, both lose their powers but continue living their inhuman lives.
