I didn’t understand what you were talking about, so I don’t think this is an appropriate response, but…

I think it’s wonderful…to be able to grow old and do anything you want.

The idea is so surprising to me, and I can’t even imagine something like that at all…this is all so new to me.

This is an image of a dream.
A world that will never be seen, a world that never will be.
Yet you still envision it…
The sight of this girl slightly older than before, surrounded by flowers.
