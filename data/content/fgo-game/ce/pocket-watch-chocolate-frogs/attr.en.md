Valentine’s gift from Sakamoto Ryouma & Valentine’s Day chocolate from Oryou.

An imported pocket watch from their business along with chocolate frogs made by Oryou. Don’t worry, there aren’t any real frogs in the chocolates, though Oryou didn’t actually know there shouldn’t be… Scary…

“It’s always been my dream to set up a shop that handles foreign products like this. Eh? Put Oryou’s chocolate frogs in the lineup too? Fine, fine, I’ll put them out in the storefront for all to see.”

…This is the story of the dragon and giant serpent’s dream shop that never came true.
