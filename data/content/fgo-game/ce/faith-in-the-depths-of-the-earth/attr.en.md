My path is drenched with blood.

I executed hundreds of nobles, and slew tens of thousands of enemy soldiers.

The cruelty that attacked me, and the cruel acts I carried out, forged my body into a deadly weapon.

But I cannot stop.
I must defend the love of the Lord, and the teachings of the Lord.
That is what makes a man.

My friend told me once that my faith would lead me into madness.
But no, that is not true.
As my rage threatens to drive me mad, the light of the Lord is the only thing that keeps me sane.

â€¦But this place is too dark.
This armor of iron, these stake-like fingers, they no longer feel warmth no matter who touches them.
I pray that someday, this light will guide the warmth I lost to touch my cheeks once more.
