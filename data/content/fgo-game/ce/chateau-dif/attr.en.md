A prison tower, from which no one has escaped alive.
Its True Name is the Château d’If.
Synonymous with hell itself, the tower holds the most unforgivable of criminals.
People say the torments of this world are gathered there.
People say it constantly echoes with voices of anger, grief, and sadness.
People say imprisonment there is the end, and that there is no escape.

And so, if anyone ever escaped this place alive…
Then they would be burdened with limitless resentment.
They would likely be human…and yet inhuman at the same time.
Doubtlessly having overcome their humanity, only to be possessed by a dark demon.

“Yes! That’s me, all right!
Someone cast into hell and devoured by it, who survived nevertheless!
None but I have done so!
I have gone beyond love and hate!
Vengeance… With these hands, I shall have my vengeance!”
