Tamaya! Kagiya!

Wrong, wrong, wrong! Whenever you see those brilliantly colorful fireworks light up the night sky, THIS is what you shout:

Heyo! Ooe’s oni fireworks!

The summer’s oni fireworks bloom like a fiery flower in Mt. Ooe’s night sky!

One need not even listen carefully to hear an oni cackling…

A single oni shouting, who’s enjoying the festivities.
