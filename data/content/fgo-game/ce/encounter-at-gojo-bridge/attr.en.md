This is not my past.
I have mearly dreamt it, but thereâ€™s no question it took place in reality.
A young warrior, as nimble as a bird, and a warrior monk that followed him around like a tornado.

An epic filled with adventure, and the meeting of the two that everyone knows.

This is not my past; however I must remember it as such.
So when at one point, I talk to someone about it, this lie will seem like the proud truth.
