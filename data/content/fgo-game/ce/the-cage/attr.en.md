To write a story is to be entrapped by its tale.

The agony of the mermaid princess that echoes from the depths.
A match’s flame that freezes the flesh.
So many endings cursed by the good.

But what about it?
I’m not searching for salvation from the get-go.
What I’m looking for is that resentment.
The voice that resents the end is truly the motivation for the writer of children’s stories.
