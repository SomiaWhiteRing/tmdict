It’s a little late for a meeting time.
The clock tower’s hand indicates that the night is short.
In her gorgeous tree dress, the girl playfully smiles.

“The night is nice in England too.

The goddess who envelopes herself with dazzling stars is truly like a Christmas fantasy.
Just a hop and a skip to anywhere.
Her heart is light and her steps are lighter still. She makes everything sparkle and glitter.
