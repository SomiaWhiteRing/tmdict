I had every intention of tricking and devouring him.

I was thinking how to trick this seemingly foolish human into pulling this cursed spear out, and how to eat him when he did. But he didn’t even give me time to say anything, and just pulled the spear out without a moment’s hesitation.

Despite the fact that I had spent grueling years harboring so much hatred and resentment towards the ones who had sealed me away, this human had the gall to just say, “Had a rough time, huh?”. Then he simply climbed back down the mountain.

When he said this so casually, like it was nothing, I started to think of it that way too. I forgot all about those wretched humans who sealed me away.

As I was thinking about all that, the face of that silly human flashed across my mind and it suddenly became rather unforgettable to me. I then realized that I had forgotten to devour him, and so I decided I would pursue him.

This is just a story of an incident at that mountain.
