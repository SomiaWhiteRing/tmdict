Uh, don’tcha think killing others if you’re a monk is contradictory? I sure do.
But the world allows such contradictions because the world is just so packed full of things.
If you don’t kill, you’ll be killed…but that’s not all.
Those one should protect can be killed.
In order to protect the weak, kill the enemy that is weakness itself.
This great contradiction is my life…my spearmanship.

Oh don’t worry. I’m used to suffering after a lifetime of it. I don’t call myself a monk for nothing!
