It’s the bare minimum of etiquette, you know.

That was what she said.
When one devote yourself to enjoy a seaside vacation, “etiquette” is something expected from a lady.

For example, a flower with large petals.
A tropical hibiscus to decorate beautiful black hair.

For example, throwing knives.
Eleven of them, unobtrusively wrapped around her body.

And a swimsuit and pareo, woven from magical energy.
Supposedly they’re tougher than thick steel.

“Wearing dazzling clothes is also a woman’s etiquette.
To be ready for sudden combat is also a woman’s etiquette.
Neither of these can be neglected. It’s only natural, right?”

…I see.
…Etiquette.

Her way of life is always beautiful and sturdy.
