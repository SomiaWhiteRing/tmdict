─Fifty-five shillings.
Yes, I obtained this by paying a mere fifty-five shillings.

Normally, I would not dream of boasting, but this one violin is an exception.
A Stradivarius. Stradi for short.
Crafted by humanity’s greatest producer of violins: Antonio Stradivari.
Truly the supreme, exquisite instrument.

Of course, I obtained it legitimately.
I simply purchased it from a pawn shop that had it on display.
For some reason, it wound up there, its true value unknown and unappreciated.
And thus, I reached out to save it.
Even one so calm and composed as I must admit…

…I had never been more proud of my observational skills!
