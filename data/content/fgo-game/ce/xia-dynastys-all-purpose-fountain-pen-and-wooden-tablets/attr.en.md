A gift from Chen Gong.

An explanation is in order: any high-precision destructible weapon has a safety device installed to trigger an emergency shutdown in case it should go berserk. But if someone can purposefully trigger the safety device to intentionally cause it to malfunction, they would be invincible in modern warfare…at least that’s the inhumane intent for this Xia Dynasty’s All-Purpose Fountain Pen the genius tactician has concocted.

“The item also secretly functions as a gift when someone reaches adulthood, making it perfect. They say you make seven enemies when you go out into the world, and so self-defense is a must for your development. The wooden tablets? Ah, they’re just an added bonus. There’s no particular lesson on them that would be instantly effective anyway, but maybe reading them would be good way to kill time.”

There can be no doubt as to which is the more important gift.
