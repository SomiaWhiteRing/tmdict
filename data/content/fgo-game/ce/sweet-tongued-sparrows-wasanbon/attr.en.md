Valentine’s Day chocolate from Beni-Enma.

It’s not chocolate, but a Japanese confectionary called wasanbon. The sugary product is shaped like the Sparrow’s Inn, and it’s a masterpiece of lovely, easy to eat, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, making it one of the ultimate wasanbon confections out there. It even has a hint of chocolate liqueur, so it even works in that sense as a delightful chocolate. The talent of Enma-tei’s proprietress really shines in this dish.

“Everything should be tried at least once. Western confections are nice, too, Master!”
