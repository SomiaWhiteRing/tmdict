Well, in the end, what sort of weapon is best?
Even the finest helmet and gauntlets will eventually be smashed, and a famed and polished sword will break or vanish.
Weapons and armor and equipment.
Only fools would worry over such things.
If you hit something with a weapon, let it kill.
If armor protects you from an attack or two, excellent.
A blunt sword is fine.
Second-rate supplies? No problem!
Even low quality armor can save you, and even a blunt sword can kill a man.
…Even so, they’d still always polish everything up for me. My men, my father, my wife, my brother… Always.
Let’s spare each other such boorish talk, I guess I should act like a hero sometimes.
Ah! Embarrassing! Embarrassing!
