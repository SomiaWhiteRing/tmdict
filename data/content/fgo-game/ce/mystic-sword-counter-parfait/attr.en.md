Valentine’s Day chocolate from swimsuit Miyamoto Musashi.

There’s some chocolate in there, so it barely counts! At least that’s her excuse. There are two spoons and two straws so a couple can enjoy it together. The stick-shaped cookies that protrude from the chocolate parfait are supposed to represent Musashi’s five blades. Dividing them up between two people will leave one left over, and it’s up to the couple how that one cookie should be split and eaten.

You really gambled on this one, Miyamoto Musashi!
