A future and past, others and the world… All are impure.
So the girl claimed.
As long as I exist, other flowers are unnecessary.

But her memories of days past destroyed her solitary and proud heart.
There’s no limit to things that are radiant.
She learned the weakness of loving beauty other than herself.

“Yes, it’s true that I learned about love.
But my pride is unchanged.
Beloved things are to be obtained. Beautiful things simply need to be put in their place.
I shall use that love as stepping stones, and I shall shine as a star above the lake.
Isn’t that the greatest form of appreciation and the least I can do to repay all those who have loved me?”

The queen of nectar boldly smiles.
She embraces the flowers that were gifted to her…without trampling on them.
