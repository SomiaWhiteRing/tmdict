Are you asking about this bull?

Why yes, this dear creature was a gift from the great god Zeus.
Don’t you think he’s lovely?
He’s like Zeus himself.

What’s that?
Am I permitted to describe the great Zeus as lovely, you ask?

Well, I suppose you’re right.
It does make me sound a bit haughty, doesn’t it?
But you know what?
In my eyes, the great Zeus is a lovely, cute, and wonderful being.

He could have stayed in his true form, but he took the trouble of turning himself into a bull. Doesn’t that make him even more wonderful and endearing?
That is how I felt about him when I met him on that fateful day.

Hehe…you don’t understand, you say?
Well, there may be a day when you will come to understand how I feel, Master.
