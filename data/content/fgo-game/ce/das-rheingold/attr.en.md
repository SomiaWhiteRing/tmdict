The family of mist told the hero at his death, “The treasure was cursed.”
They were right about that.
Everything went wrong.
Nobody could stop it.

The hero has no attachment to the gold but he couldn’t throw it away because it was obvious that it would start shining as soon as it is thrown. On that day, the curse came true.
