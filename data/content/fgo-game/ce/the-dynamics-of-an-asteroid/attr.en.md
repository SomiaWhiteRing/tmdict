You know that old mountain climber saying?
“Why do I climb Mount Everest? Because it’s there.”
People inherently want to challenge their limits, and I can’t help but want to confirm my own hypothesis.

You see, Master, I did the calculations, and I concluded that I can, in fact, do this.
Now, I have no choice but to see if I was correct, even if I must resort to evil to do so!

Hmm, yes, it’s all quite backwards, isn’t it.
Instead of destroying the world because I’m evil, I became evil in order to destroy the world!
