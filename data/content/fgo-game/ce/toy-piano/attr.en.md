Valentine’s return gift from Amadeus.

An antique mini piano decorative item.
There aren’t that many keys, but it still plays music.
Actually, it has a recording function: Wolfgang Recorder.
Be it a toy piano or real one, if Amadeus plays on it, it becomes an exquisite piece of music. That’s not fair.
