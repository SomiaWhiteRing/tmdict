During her childhood, she saw a warm light.

A smoky ink-colored sky.
Droplets gently trickled down her cheeks.
Even though everyone had rejected her, even if nobody loved her, she thought she heard it tell her that she was allowed to be “here.”

Time passed, crimes were committed, and many sins piled high.
Even if her days of atonement were endless, and her sense of salvation never came as long as she lived, she was resolved to live in this world.

…Like enduring a long night.

From the silence, she begins walking to feel the nostalgic summer rain.
