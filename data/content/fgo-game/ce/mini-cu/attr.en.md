Valentine’s return gift from Cú Chulainn (Alter).

It’s a plushie that looks familiar.
You asked Medb, but she says she’s never seen it before.

If you put it next to your pillow at night, in the morning you might find that it’s moved on its own, or become tattered.
Should that happen, it’d be best to just go ahead and re-stuff it with cotton and fix it up.
