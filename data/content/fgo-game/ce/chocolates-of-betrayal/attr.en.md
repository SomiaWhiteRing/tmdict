Valentine’s chocolate from Semiramis.

Did I say that there was no poison in it?
Hm. Yes, I suppose I did.
But think about it, Master.
Poison doesn’t work on you, and this small amount of poison would not affect Servants, either.

So, that means it is not REALLY poison, but simply chocolates that only you can enjoy.

…And at the same time, this is also chocolate that someday, you will no longer be able to eat. Isn’t this how a Servant-Master relationship works?

Ah, don’t let that sadden you.
After all, it is still delicious.
All you need to do right now is indulge in it.
