Valentine’s gift from Li Shuwen (Assassin).

A sword carved from a peach tree. While it may not be lethal, teacher Shuwen was diligent in crafting it, so it’s at least effective against dead spirits.

“Maybe I should add a talisman soaked in chicken blood and ink? I suppose that’s going too far. After all, your ultimate weapons are the Servants who protect their Master. That is to say, us.”

The sword also has a cult following among Servants like Fuuma Kotarou and Sakata Kintoki, and there’s an extensive waiting list to rent it out.
