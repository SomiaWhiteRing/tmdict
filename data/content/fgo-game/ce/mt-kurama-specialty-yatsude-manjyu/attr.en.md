Valentine’s Day chocolate from Ushiwakamaru (Assassin).

Sweet chocolate wrapped in soft castella batter and baked in a mold to make a truly delectable product.

“Hahaha! It’s so playful, just like me! And filling it with chocolate is so original! I have no doubt you will enjoy it, Master!”

The confection is shaped like the paperplant, a leaf that’s often called a tengu’s fan. It absolutely does not resemble the maple leaf.

To be PERFECTLY CLEAR, it has absolutely nothing to do with the confection famous in Hiroshima prefecture! AT ALL!
