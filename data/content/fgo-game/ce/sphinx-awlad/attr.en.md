Valentine’s return gift from Ozymandias.

A few of what appear to be the offspring of the Cosmo Sphinx (pseudonym) that appears during his EX attack.
In size and behavior, they are very similar to lion cubs, and they’re pretty cute.
Be aware that they are gigantic when fully mature.

By the way, it’s unknown how long it takes for these cubs to mature.
