Valentine’s Day chocolate from Mysterious Heroine XX.

Sweets that glitter brightly in starry space. Their deliciousness goes beyond mere five-star rank to create a new “super star” rank!

“What do you think!? Using my authority as a space cop, I special ordered it from the galaxy’s most famous shop and had them design it from the ground up! Eh? It’s cool but it’s too much? Ah-ha, that’s good of you to notice, Master! I mean, having two is more fitting for a heroine than just one, right!?”

You really think so? A heroine wouldn’t choose their own weapon using chocolate in the first place, you know?
