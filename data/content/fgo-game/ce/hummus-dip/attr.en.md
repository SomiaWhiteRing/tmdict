Valentine’s return gift from Arash.

A mountain of bread baked to a golden brown, and plenty of hummus (a dip made with ground chickpeas).
A fragrant aroma wafts through the air and stimulates your appetite. Naan is more filling than pita, when it comes to bread!
…Or so he says.
Now come, don’t hold back and eat up.
