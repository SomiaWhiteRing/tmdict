Her fight was over.

Jhansi, her homeland, fell. Even the city of Kalpi where she found refuge, had to be abandoned. Gawlior was her final destination, and that was where her story ended.

What legacy did she leave for those who lived on? Was it the crumbled palace walls? Was it the dead bodies tragically stacked up? Or was it the dire reality that even a heroic queen could not conquer her merciless providence?

None of these.
The people saw something altogether different: it was still there.
The people realized something altogether different: it should never be forgotten.

It was a future that the queen anticipated and prepared for, and it was something that the people themselves needed to protect.

And thatâ€™s why her, or rather, THEIR fight was not over.

It was actually just the beginning.
