A cool, hip romantic comedy of school life. It is a story of an ordinary main character who deepens his bond with various heroines.

The first heroine is able to communicate with spirits, and knew the main character long before the main character knew her. When they are reunited a few years later, it appears he forgot the important promise made with the heroine. “Hnngh. It feels like I’d be a loser if I reminded him of my promise…so I’ll make the spirits jog his memory!” Oh, also, within just two days of their reunion, there was a whole scare about the main character having to suddenly move away.

The second heroine is a senpai-next-door sort of heroine who had always taken good care of the main character. She could be both stern and sweet. The way she embraces the main character is more akin to how a big sister or mother might do so. But, be warned that she can be more frightening than an oni when angered. “Oh my, look how dirty you are. Would you like me to give you a bath while I rubby-rub you all clean like we did back in the day?”

The third heroine is…well, she’s a stalker who fell in love with the main character at first sight after he came into her home to shelter from the rain. Their first words were exchanged when the main character peeked under his bed in the middle of the night, sensing something strange. “I love you! Kya! I said it! When should we sign our marriage certificate?”

At their school, there’s an urban legend that says that anyone who summons the goddess of love under the legendary tree will find the love they desire. But obviously, the heroines vying for the affection of the main character surely will not let their rivals get ahead. And so, the goddess who flirts with the bear remains up in the heavens, while the great war for love rages down on the surface…
