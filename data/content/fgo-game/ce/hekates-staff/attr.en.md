The staff bestowed by the Goddess Hekate, and the only thing that reminds me of my homeland.

No matter how good I am at magecraft, no matter how much knowledge I have over magecraft, my lost homeland will never come back.

And so, at least let me leave behind a trace of my legacy.
Oh Goddess Hekate, may your blessing be upon my one and only beloved disciple, and let her enjoy those harsh yet fulfilling days, as I did with my dear sister-in-training.
