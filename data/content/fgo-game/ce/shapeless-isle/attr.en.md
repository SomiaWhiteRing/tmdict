After suffering persecution, the three sisters escaped to this island.

On the tiny island there was only the ruins of a temple and the sound of crashing waves.
There was no bountiful forest, loving animals, or flourid offerings.

Yet, their lives were filled with tranquility.
As long as the sisters could live a peaceful life together, and as long as the youngest could live for the sake of her two older sisters, there was no greater blessing.

Even if it was a dream that shall be lost one day.
