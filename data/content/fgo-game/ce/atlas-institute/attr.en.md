One of the three great branches of the Mageâ€™s Association, it is an institution of accumulation and instrumentation.
An underground academy created by the alchemists who strive to investigate the true structure of the world.
However, the studies to protect the future only generated theories that would deliver a future even more bleak, and it is said that the final result was the creation of weapons that would destroy the world seven times over.

Thou shalt not touch upon that academy.
Atlas is an armory of destruction. Lift not its seal for any purposes.
