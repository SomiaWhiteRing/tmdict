I became famous as a painter, but I basically did anything people wanted me to.
I crafted tools and weapons…
I designed cities and made ships.

What I always thought of was “the creation of all things.”
The artificial bird, the staff that displays the stars, the all-purpose combat universal gauntlet…
They were all products of that thought.
I sought perfect beauty.
For that, I needed to know many things. That’s all.

Huh? Did I ever finish perfect beauty?
Of course I did, and fairly early on, too!
But that was just my personal opinion.
I worked day and night as a genius to gain affection for my work and reach greater heights.
I took students, traveled, and sometimes healed the hearts of men.
I’m a genius, but I’m not cold-hearted.
Because I knew completed beauty, you see.
One who does not love humanity cannot grow as a human.
It’s very simple.
Though it did take me a while to find that out, you know?
