Valentineâ€™s Days chocolates from Hassan of the Hundred Personas.

A medley of big and small, good and bad.
Bite-sized things that look like chocolates are packed in. A bag full of dreams.
It may look store-bought, but everything here is handmade by Hassan.
They are overly intricate, so it might be safe to assume that the chocolates represent sentiments that are not usually put into words.
