The road continues, and the wheels turn.
The point the Universal Man strived to reach.
Beyond the dream of the Gran Cavallo.

We do not stop taking steps.
The sky goes on infinitely, and the world spans outward beneath it.
Even if the world turns into a blank canvas.

What awaits beyond the horizon?
Is it the future we all anticipated?
Could it be yet another threat?
Either way, the suspense makes one’s heart race.
Even when this journey ends, your adventures continue.
I’m proud of that above all else.

Wonderful memories of the journey.
Wonderful travel companions.
My wonderful life.

Ah, everything is so beautiful.
Just like a painting.
