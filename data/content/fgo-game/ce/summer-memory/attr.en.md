Summer memories?

Hehe, that’s right.
There were so many wonderful memories, it’s hard to choose just one.

But today I’ll tell you about the Petit Trianon, I guess.
It was a palace a little ways from Versailles that I rebuilt from the ground up myself.

I made its grounds to look like you were in the middle of mother nature.
An English-style guardian, you see.
I’m not sure what you’d call it in your time.
There was so much greenery, and beaches, and rocky mountains and even caves.
A little shrine…
Oh, and there was also this cute little sphinx.

I loved it.
Yes, I loved relaxing there in the summer, and talking with my little sister and my friends.

I think sometimes I’d take off my court clothes and put on the dresses that were popular that season.
Or maybe a hat to keep out the sun.
Oh, dear… It’s just like the vacation I’m having right now, isn’t it?
