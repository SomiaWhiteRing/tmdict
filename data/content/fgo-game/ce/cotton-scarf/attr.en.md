Valentine’s return gift from Okada Izo.

It’s a similar cotton scarf to the one Izo wears around his neck, but this one has its own pattern and is a bit more stylish.

It’s not clear whether scarves were trendy during the Bakumatsu, but they were often worn by sick or retired people.

“And if you hide your mouth like this, nobody’ll get a clear look at your face at night, making this perfect for man-slaying. What? We match? Quit yer nonsense!”

“…Well, just be careful not to get killed while you sleep, ’kay?”
