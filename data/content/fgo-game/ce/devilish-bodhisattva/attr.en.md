Let me tell you the story of a woman.

“Oh, you are so lovely…”

Says the woman, as if speaking to a baby at her breast. Humanity is nothing but young beasts.
Ephemeral fruit that devour their desires, and melt in them, drown in them.
So who could deny this great and infinite love?

Enlightenment and Nirvana are hers to command.
Your final destination is the paradise that is Sessyoin.

“Oh, how lovely… Seven billion lives meeting their end, simply to find me.”

Her whispers drowning you in lust, she cradles the globe in her hand, as if cradling a baby at her breast.
