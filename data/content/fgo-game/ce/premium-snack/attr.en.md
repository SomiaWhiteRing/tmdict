Valentine’s chocolate from Suzuka Gozen.

A so-called “regional specialty snack.”
It’s unclear where and during what period it was created.
It’s a simple sort of treat, but still special. Suzuka’s thoughtful attentiveness is reflected in her choice.

“Like, we can totes do that thing like in the dog movie where they share spaghetti!”
