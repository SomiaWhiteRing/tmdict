Ah…I see. I get it now.

So I really was forgetting something.
I had a feeling that was the case.

So tell me…
What is this important thing that I’ve forgotten?

This is but a vision of a dream.
Kind parents, friendly older brothers and sisters, a cute younger sister, and a beloved pet dog…
This is a scene of a family that disappeared, victims of the cycle of madness…
Yet, you still imagine it…you see the prayer of the young girl who had forgotten everything, coming to fruition at the end of it all.
