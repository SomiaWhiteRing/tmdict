A single bolt shot from a crossbow flawlessly pierced an apple.

Even if he seemed calm and collected, that bolt was not at all shot in a mindless and mechanical way. There was hesitation behind that shot. There was fear, trepidation, and even the weakness of a desire to flee from it all.

Even so, he swallowed all those feelings to save his son, and he pulled the trigger.

One may call that shot a miracle or the work of God.
But God had nothing to do with it.

It was the drive of one father, and the skills that he cultivated over many years, that saved his son.

This is not a heroic tale of myth, but a story of a simple human.

There’s no need to be embarrassed by the fact that he prepared a second bolt. After all, to admit to one’s limitations and weaknesses is proof of true strength.
