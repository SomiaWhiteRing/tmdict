In ten steps, I will make my kill.
The self-proclaimed hero is trembling, frozen in fear.
Completely useless, but that’s the way it is.
Ultimately, I am the one who made this plan and perfected it.
I can do it at this distance.
I won’t be interfered with at this distance.
Just a few more seconds, and I can see his face looking at me, begging for mercy.
Soon, my life will be reaching its end.
My life is filled with joy, I have no regrets.
…Well then, here I come.
It’s time to make the leap, to my hated and beloved emperor.
