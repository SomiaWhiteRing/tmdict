On August 3rd, 1492, he departed from the port of Palos in Spain, with three ships named La Santa María, La Pinta, and La Niña.

“Somehow we managed to stick together until we made landfall, but the big-butt Miss María ran aground on the coast of the island we named La Española. On top of that, Captain Pinzón snuck off with La Pinta. I don’t know if he wanted to be the first to find gold or what, and I don’t care either.”

“So I had no choice but to use La Niña the rest of the time, on the way back to Spain, too. In other words, I was sailing this girl the majority of my first voyage…”

“Huh? How do you distinguish between a good and bad ship?
Doesn’t matter what it looks like, how big, or how much money was spent on it. The best ships are the ones who would take you to your destination safely. If they don’t, they’re trash. That’s obvious.”
