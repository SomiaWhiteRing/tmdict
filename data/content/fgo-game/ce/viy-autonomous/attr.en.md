Valentine’s Day chocolate from Anastasia.

Since the duchess didn’t really have any affinity for chocolates, the little schwipsig in her created a new Viy to give as a gift. It moves around in the middle of the night to attack any suspicious intruders.

…At least that was the intent, but it seems to have formed a rivalry with another stuffed toy who arrived before it, and a raging battle between the two ensues each night.

“But it’s okay. My little Viy will definitely win!”

The duchess is nothing if not confident.
