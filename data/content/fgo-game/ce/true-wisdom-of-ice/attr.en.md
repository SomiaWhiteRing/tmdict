The world creates puzzles at times. It may be coincidental. It may be intentional, malicious, or all for show…

And there are many more reasons why they are created. If so, what could solve such puzzles?

Wisdom.

This object…hook it around your ear and look upon the world through its lenses. What was hidden is revealed and what was once blurry becomes clear.

Also, according to Brynhild, “You are more dashing when you wear that wisdom.”

What do you think, my Master?

I hope that you also think I look good in them…
