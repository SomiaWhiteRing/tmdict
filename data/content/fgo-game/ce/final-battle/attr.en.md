…All my men either shattered or ran away, leaving myself, thin and fatigued, and the quivering young knight who held his ground.

Will this large shield offer protection from the dragon’s breath?
Even if it does, how can the dragon be slain?
Where exactly is its weakness?
How much difficulty must be endured in order to strike that?
Time has slowed down.
Therefore, there is time to think.
Why am I fighting? Did I want to fight?
The passion of my youth has long since left me and all that is left is a wish for peace, or so I thought.
“…Oh, I see.”
The fighting spirit that I thought had vanished begins to burn once more.
I shall die here.
This is a fitting hell to end my life.

After getting old, the passion that I had when I defeated Grendel is gone.
However, there was peace behind me.
A countless number of people enjoyed modest happiness, and are even now doing their best to live a life without despair.

“Once in a while, I should act like a king.”

Not for myself, nor for glory or wealth.
As a king, it is my duty.
Be revived…Beowulf.
Your strength is far from what it was in the golden age…
But it is definitely not zero.
