The summer of water has ended.
The curtain has fallen on this dazzling show.
The heavenly water palace erected in the middle of the desert has, like many fairy tales, disappeared along with the myriad dreams it carried.
A goddess’ capricious whims do not last so long.
My stage was also some kind of mistake.

But still…just a bit more. There’s still one faint ray of light left.
If one spotlight left on can be like a star, pulsing like a beacon in the sky.
Even if you won’t remember it, or even if it doesn’t remain in this world…
I shall gift, with all of my gratitude, a sequence just for you.

Memories will forever be blue.
The lone swan will reminisce on her past love.
