My name is Gringolet, the fairy steed.
A gorilla rides upon my back.

No, that’s not right. It’s not a gorilla. It’s Sir Galatine.
His silver armor is heavy enough, but even though that guy may look like a slender, handsome man, his muscle density is crazy, and he weighs way more than you’d think.
But his heroic aura is like the shining sun, which means it’s always really hot wherever he is, making him a hot-blooded man who usually rides a thousand leagues in a day.
During combat, he won’t stop until he’s annihilated his enemy, and he’ll often go three days and three nights without sleeping.
He’s a noble and honest man, and although stubborn, from the amount of time I’ve spent with him I know the delicateness of his heart, his strength, and his sternness more than anyone.

I am Gringolet, the fairy steed. Today again, I conquer the plains with Sir Galatine.
No, that’s wrong again. It’s Sir Galain.
