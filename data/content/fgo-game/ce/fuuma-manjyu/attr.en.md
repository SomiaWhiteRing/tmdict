Valentine’s return gift from Fuuma Kotarou.

A nutritional supplement that was developed by everyone in the Fuuma Village.
A single manjyu contains a whole day’s worth of nutrients, and it’s truly a ninja tool of your dreams for the new age.

With one of these, you could get through any difficult mission!
It’s a light, portable package, and it’s easy to carry around.

The only bad thing: its texture is like eating a brillo pad and it smells like raw fish gone bad. But that’s nothing to worry over.
