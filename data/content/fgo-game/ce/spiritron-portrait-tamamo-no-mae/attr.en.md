Nero’s rival, and the bearer of the other symbol of kingship.

A beautiful girl who’s easily recognizable for her fluffy fox tail and soft ears.
A self-proclaimed “good wife” Heroic Spirit, she does her best to serve her Master, but when she gets angry she’s extremely scary.
She creates the entertainment hall “Millennial Heian Kyoto” and spends her days gathering Servants and NPCs, but…?

“Hmm?
Oppressive government? Hellish taxes and abuse?
Yes, I’m sure that’s true.
That’s how I’m running the place, after all!
I, Tamamo-no-Mae, will do whatever it takes to get my way, until SE.RA.PH is united!☆"
