“You impress me, Quetzalcoatl!
You’re managing to keep up with me… Are you perhaps also a goddess of the wind? Maybe you don’t even need to ride a winged dragon!?”
“Same to you, Ishtar, yes! I thought relying on your boat had made you weak, but you’ve got the legs like that of an impala! This is getting interesting… This big sister is getting fired up! I think it’s time to go all-out, yes!”

Two goddesses who both possess the guardianship of Venus…working together in a united front. Both women hate to lose, so there’s only one thing they strive for.

Run faster than anyone else…until victory is within their grasp.
