Valentine’s chocolate from Da Vinci.

A perfect chocolate that even somehow emits light.
The strong backlight makes it difficult to see the actual item, but it’s a Vitruvian-looking anatomical diagram chocolate.

“Love? Of course it’s packed with it!
It’s solely from an academic and medical standpoint…but I don’t know the difference!”
