…The beauty of nature. The silvery white flower fluttering under the moon.

I am the Lancer of Flourishing Eight, Echigo’s god of war, Nagao Kagetora!

That’s right. Now that the strongest fighter in the Warring States is here, so you can breathe easy! Bring on the arrows or bullets!

And please use this Craft Essence to increase EXP.
