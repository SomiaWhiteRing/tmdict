Valentine’s return gift from the Vice Commander.

Medicine that is said to have been peddled by the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata Toshizo.
It’s said to be effective for broken bones, bruises, sprains, and muscle strain.
While he was training in his youth, he traveled around the country peddling this medicine, though he stopped after the Shinsengumi was formed.
Hijikata personally harvested the knotweeds to create this medication. As a side note, the Vice Commander’s medicine is especially bitter.

“Don’t you dare think you can go out and die on your own without my permission.”
