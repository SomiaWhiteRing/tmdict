If it weren’t for this assassination, I would not have been summoned as a Servant.
But this assassination wasn’t supposed to be recorded in history books.
At least that’s what I thought.
I simply thought that the world and society would be a better place if he died.

…How foolish of me.

I should have failed.
I should I have been met with retaliation.
I should have changed my mind and turned back.
But the truth is I’m a murderer. An assassin.
I’m a good-for-nothing criminal.

Yet…
One good thing came out of this.
The fact that I was able to meet you. That’s my only consolation…
