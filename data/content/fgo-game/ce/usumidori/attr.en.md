The sword that beheaded the Earth Spider and exterminated monsters now slays men and steals lives.
All the heroic tales are stories of the past.
I will continue to taint this blade with the blood of men.
I am ashamed my ancestors would see it as thus.
Still, if I were to trouble them further, I would wish this sword to be sharper.
Oh no, I would not ask much, I would merely ask it be capable of taking a hundred heads in one swing.
See, taking lives one person at a time is so bothersome.
