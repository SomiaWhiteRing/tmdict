“Why did she wear that wreath?”

The Chain of the Heavens whispered to no one in particular.
A monster it once fought.
A monster who was its friend until the battle.
A terrifying monster with claws sharper than anything, even the Chain of the Heavens.
But there was a wreath of flowers on her head.
The flowers the Chain of the Heavens had once planted in the Cedar Forest.
Those tiny, pale flowers.
The flower garden that the Chain had bent the laws of Earth to create, for the sake of that monster with the heart of a little girl.

“The very simplicity of this gift reached her pure heart.”

Thus spoke the man who stood next to the Chain of the Heavens, and returned to the city, leaving behind the second wreath for his friend.
