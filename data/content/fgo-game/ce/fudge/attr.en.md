A gift from Gray.

Simple sweets.
This traditional English confection is remarkably sweet and probably pairs well with coffee. Grandmothers are known to make it for their grandchildren, and Gray’s Welsh mother probably made it for her child in the same loving spirit…likely before her child’s face transformed.

Also, since Goredolf and Archer of Red intervened, the brownies apparently aren’t as sweet.
