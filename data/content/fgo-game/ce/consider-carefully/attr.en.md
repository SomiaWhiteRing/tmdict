I get it!
So I just need to decide who’s the most beautiful, right?
But I don’t know!
Huh? Reward? A bribe?
I see. I guess anything goes when it comes to competitions between deities.
I’ll win wars? I can become king?
Hmmm, none of those are that enticing…

Wait, the world’s most beautiful woman will be my bride?
I choose that!

…AHHH! Why do I do things without thinking them through!?
