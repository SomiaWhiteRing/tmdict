Listen up. You can’t get sloppy if you’re going to live the pirate life. You shouldn’t pillage as you fancy, or drink as you please and lose control. You’re gonna have to forget those kind of pipe dreams as a pirate.

What’s important are laws. Rules. Comradery.
One for all, and all for one.
There’s nothing you can do because you’re a pirate, but there’s tons of thing you CAN’T do because you’re a pirate.

Knowing all that, do you still want to board my pirate ship?
If you do…
Well, welcome to my pirate crew!

I wish you nothing but success in making a name for yourself as a pirate!
