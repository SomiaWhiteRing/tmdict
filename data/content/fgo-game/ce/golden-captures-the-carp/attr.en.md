The painting of a carp leaping high as the sky, together with Sakata Kintoki.

Since ancient times, it is said that carps will transform into dragons when they climb up swift currents.
When drawn together with Sakata Kintoki, the personification of physical health, the painting is then said to be able to bring forth success, luck, and good health.

But the bear has nothing to do with it.
