Valentine’s chocolate from Pārvatī.

If I had only made it hollow…
Oh, why did I go and make it one big solid chocolate?

A surge of sweetness assaults them.
Cacao, cacao, and more cacao fall upon them like an avalanche.
6,500,000 calories, which is a whole new kind of violence.
An intense sense of euphoria causes one to lose consciousness.
Ah, that’s a good one.
Is it an elbow? A knee?
No, it’s a fist.
And this one’s a joint.
…Actually, I don’t know what I’m talking about anymore…
Attack it, like a hungry wolf.
Nobody is hungry, yet nobody has gotten tired of its taste.
One by one, the chocolate defeats the assembled Servants.
Jaguar Warrior, take responsibility.
Try your best, Medusa.
Cú Chulainn just wants to join in.
Emiya, just…try.
Medea, isn’t there some kind of magecraft that diminishes calories, or something that could send our stomachs to the underworld…!?

And when the final morsel is consumed, the river of tears is certainly not for show.

Thank you for the chocolate.
It was very delicious.
