Valentine’s Day chocolate from Astraea.

Chocolate eaten with Astraea. It’s semi-sweet dark chocolate, decorated with sparkly stars. One wine bottle is still sealed. The goddess of the balance scales waits patiently till the day when that bottle can be opened. She waits for that miraculous moment when the impossible promise is fulfilled.
