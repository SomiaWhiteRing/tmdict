Coyote loves pranks, and one day he stole the Sun’s tobacco.

The Sun got mad, and chased after him in a fury.
Coyote loves pranks but he is weak, so he had no choice but to run from east to west.

He dropped the tobacco as he ran, and by the time that it bloomed and had grown seeds, the Sun gave up and stopped.

Coyote didn’t want to give tobacco to humans, but when they offered him a bride, he decided to shared it.
Well, when he found out that bride was actually a young boy, he broke down in tears, but that’s how we started smoking tobacco!
