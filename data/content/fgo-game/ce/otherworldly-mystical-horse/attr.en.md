The mythical beast called the griffin once roamed this world.
Devouring both man and horse, rumor said there was no beast more brutal.
The spawn of such a brutal beast and a mare is called a Hippogriff.
…An animal that mates with its prey doesn’t exist.
That’s why a hippogriff is essentially an impossible magical beast.
…Or so they say.
“Then, then why are you my steed?”
“Queee!”
(Translation: I think, therefore, I am. Fantasies can also be reality.)
“You don’t know? Yeah, I don’t really know, either.”
“Quaaa!”
(Translation: Oh! The world is filled with fantasies!)
“It’s fine, it’s fine. Because I love you! See? I’ll give you a big hug!”
“Gueee!”
(Translation: Please listen to me.)
