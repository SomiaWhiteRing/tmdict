Special chocolate-flavored hot springs manjyu from Yang Guifei.

Dried lychee are the secret ingredient. The big one was made by Yang Guifei herself, while the rest were made by her fire sprite attendants. The big manjyu seems more on the simplistic side.

“A nice dip in the bath while enjoying sweets is the best remedy when you’re tired♨ Let’s eat the manjyu while we soak ourselves in the hot springs together! Come again…? That’s not what hot springs manjyu means? Hmmm… Well I’m going to put a positive spin on this: the possibilities for these sweets are endless♨"
