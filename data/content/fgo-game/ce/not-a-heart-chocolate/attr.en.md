Valentine’s Day chocolate from Jeanne Alter (Berserker).

What? You’re gonna eat it anyway, so what does it matter what it looks like? Who cares if it’s broken, failed, or messy!? It’s fine, because you can still eat it!!!

At least… HEY! You listen and listen good! At least it tastes good, so don’t you goddamn whine to me about it! Next year… Ohhh just you wait until next year. Got it!? Next year, my chocolate is going to be SO GOOD that you’re gonna get down on your hands and knees and cry like a baby! You’ll beg for more like a fat pig!

Huh? You’re satisfied with this one? Hmph! Is that right? IS THAT RIGHT!? (Smug)
