A return gift from Mori Nagayoshi.

A bowl of tea offered at a tearoom the size of two tatami mats. The small tearoom is so cramped, your elbows almost touch each other’s arm as you two sit around the kettle. It’s a moment of bliss, as you are conscious of the host’s careful movements.

…So yeah. That’s enough of the complicated stuff. We just need to pour whatever the hell we want and drink whatever the hell we want. It’s just like killing things.

By the way, what do you think of this red tea bowl? I know Rikyukoji’s all about using black Raku ware, but I like this red bowl. It’s like the color of splattering blood, and it totally looks refined!

Uhyahahahaha! Come on now, take a sip!
