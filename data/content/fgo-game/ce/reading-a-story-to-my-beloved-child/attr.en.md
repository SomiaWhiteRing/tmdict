Valentine’s gift from Ivan the Terrible.

After strong insistence from Master, Ivan the Terrible was given the task of reading bedtime stories. And after seeing Master’s peaceful sleeping face, it seems something stirred within the tsar. The stories he tells are Russian folktales. They may be humorous, adventurous, or even cruel, but they are all read aloud. His soothing voice that reverberates throughout one’s entire body is said to help Master relax.
