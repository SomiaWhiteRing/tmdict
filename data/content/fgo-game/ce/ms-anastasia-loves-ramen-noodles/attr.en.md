A revolution exploded within the icy kingdom, and so the entire royal family fled to Japan, a nation on the precipice of an unprecedented age of ramen. The former duchess and current part-time worker Anastasia Nibutamenma Hosomenva toils without end to fund her cross-Japan ramen journey alongside Rock Boy, a boy she met and befriended in a chance encounter, who one day dreams of opening his own ramen shop.

“I live for this single bowl of ramen!”

The next issue promises a ramen battle between ramen champion Houzouin and Rock Boy.
