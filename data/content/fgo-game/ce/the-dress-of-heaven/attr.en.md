My dress?
Yes, you’re right. The colors are so beautiful…

…Hehe, thank you. I appreciate your saying that.
I like it too, actually. It’s wonderful.

This is the Robe of Heaven…
It’s also called the Dress of Heaven. But it’s a very important Mystic Code. It’s a treasure that’s been passed down in my family.

It was supposed to be used to control the Greater Grail. Maybe that’s why I’m wearing it now: because I’ve manifested as the avatar of the Grail.

…To be honest, I should be passing it down to her. She’s the homunculus who’s going to grant the great wish of the Einzberns, not me.

But no… I’m not going to do that. This is mine.
As her mother, I’m not letting go of this dress.

I want to give her whatever presents I can.
Pretty things. Cute things. All the wonderful things in the world… I want to gather them up and leave them to her.

But you know…
This curse in the shape of a dress - this, I don’t want her to have.
