Valentine’s return gift from Paracelsus.

A few baked goods on an elegant dish.
On the side, there is a teacup with freshly brewed tea.
When you look at it closely…
…the colors of the baked goods seem to represent the five elements that he regularly controls.

…How do they taste?
How do the baked goods in the colors of ether taste?
