Beautiful! So this is what a New Year’s feast looks like! I see…it is not just about making it look extravagant, but also having the food last so those who prepared it can have time to enjoy it as well. This holiday meal is definitely according to tabulations!

Mmmmmm! Delicious! Just eating supplements is definitely not going to work with a feast like this in front of me! So this is what having company in Japan is like…to make it a fun New Year! Good job, me. It was totally worth having you all come to the Wandering Sea!

Next year, make it a triple-tiered box, please!
