In Central American mythology, death is the end of growth and maturation, but it also foretells of new birth.
This is not the truth only of life, but also true of the world itself.
The world is constantly experiencing destruction and creation.

The Aztec gods will always create a new world after they destroy the old one.
The current world was also born through this process as the fifth world.

And at the center of this world (or perhaps, it is the world itself) is what allows and protects life to flourish: the sun.
Quetzalcoatl is said to be the sun of the second world, and guided the fifth sun.

The Aztecs saw the world in the sun.
They saw destruction, creation, death, and birth.
There are five suns (worlds) carved into the Sun Stone, an artifact which was once kept in the temple at Tenochtitlan, and is now kept in Mexico City.

Someday the fifth world will disappear too.
When that happens, will a new, sixth world be born?
Or perhaps…

“That’s up to you guys, yes!”
