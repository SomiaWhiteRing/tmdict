A return gift from Paris.

An Apollo plush.

First it was the Mini Cú doll, then the Viy doll, and now there’s a newcomer invading My Room.

And now Mini Cú attacks, Viy defends, and Apollo gives out Buffs. As the trio detect and attack any kind of room invader, they are the unsung heroes who protect Master’s sleep.

Sometimes they fail, though.
