Valentine’s Day chocolate from Jeanne d’Arc (Archer).

And so, I have built a sturdy piece of chocolate in the shape of leaping dolphins! Teehee, impressive, isn’t it? Luxurious, don’t you think? Come now, go ahead and praise your big sister!

…And now admiring time is over. That’s right, chocolate is made to be eaten. I’ve been looking forward to this, even while I was taste-testing and secretly taking a nibble here and there! I’ve been looking forward to the moment we would share this chocolate…

And now I’m going to break it up to make it easier to eat!
