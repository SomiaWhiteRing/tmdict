Evil ascends to the heavens and becomes a star.
Thirty-six shining Heavenly Spirits, and seventy-two glittering Earthly Fiends.
Totaling 108 all together, these stars are the stars of destiny for the heroes tasked with saving their land.

Some of them are good people, and some of them are not.
Some are instilled with a sense of righteousness, and others harbor ill intentions.
Yet all of us fear for our country, and the safety of its people.

And so, we 108 demonic stars are here.
We shall borrow human bodies and set forth in order to save this land from upheaval, regardless of what awaits us at the end!
