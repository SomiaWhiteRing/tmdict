Yes. This shield is made of divine iron.
Odin the Allfather bestowed it upon us.
My records tell me that such forging methods have been lost to the modern age.

This is an embodiment of our pride and joy. It never cracks or breaks, and it never buckles under any amount of force.

Just as our pride as warrior maidens will last for eternity, this shield of divine iron will also last for eternity.
