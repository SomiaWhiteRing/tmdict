A Valentine’s return gift from Red Hare.

Carrots with a vivid color and shine. They’re truly superb produce harvested from an underground facility. They’re packed with nutrients and totally delicious!

It appears you can take them up to the kitchen to get them prepared. The dish will differ depending on which Servant cooks it, so it’s a good idea to try several times.
