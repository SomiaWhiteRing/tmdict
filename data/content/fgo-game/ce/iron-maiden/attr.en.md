An iron coffin that sucks away much blood, and steals away many lives.
Many maidensâ€™ lives have faded away in mists, leaving behind only despairs and sorrows.
Truly, this is the work of a devil. But her true sin was that she remained.

The scream fades.
The nails under the skin get rusted.
The blood dries into stains.
The iron coffin, chained with its master, is fading away in the isolation.
