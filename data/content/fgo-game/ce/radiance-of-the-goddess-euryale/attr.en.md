That’s why I said it’s fundamentally impossible.
Do you understand?
I’m a goddess who was born to be loved.
Just as Athena and Ares were born to fight, someone like me was born to be desired, loved, and stolen by men.
I couldn’t possibly fight.

But, now that I’ve become a Servant, and an Archer, at that.

I even got a Noble Phantasm.
And look, a bow and arrow.

A bow and arrow of love. That’s Cupid’s, isn’t it?
Even I know that, you don’t have tell me, Medusa!

Still, it can’t be helped.
Since this is the hand we’re dealt, I’ll draw my bow as much as I can.
I’ll do all that I can for you… Master.
