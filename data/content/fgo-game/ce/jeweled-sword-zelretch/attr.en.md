This is a Mystic Code designed and created by Zelretch, a magician known and feared as the “Kaleidoscope.”

Its true form is not a sword, but a staff.
Although limited, it can draw out magical energy leaked from parallel worlds…
Making the Second Magic a reality and creating slashes of light from concentrated energy.
