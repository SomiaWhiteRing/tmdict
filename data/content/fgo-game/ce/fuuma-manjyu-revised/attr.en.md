Gift from Katou “Black Kite” Danzo.

A nutritional supplement that was developed by the Fuuma Clan.
Danzo improved on this old recipe.

Not only does a single manjyu contain a whole day’s worth of nutrients, but it also salves accumulated fatigue, and it is even said to temporarily increase one’s magical energy.
This tool of the ninja would be coveted by businessmen of the new age, and even mages.

The old version’s most notable characteristic was its unique texture and foul smell. And now, with the improved version…

Behold!
Nothing has changed!

The steel wool texture and raw, fishy smell remain, only now it has an…interesting aftertaste.
