I was born into this world.

Yes. I was different from my sisters from the moment I was born.
My sisters are true goddesses.
Unlike living beings, they were perfect and complete from the moment they were given form.
But I was born.
Like a human.
As a living being that would grow and change with time.

But there was a time when I thought that I might mature into a form worthy of being with my sisters.
I thought the day would come when I could wear the same clothes, look the same, and act as if I were a goddess.

Please, go ahead and laugh if you like.
It was a silly little mistake.
