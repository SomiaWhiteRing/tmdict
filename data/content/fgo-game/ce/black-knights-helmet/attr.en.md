There is no light in my path.
My mouth is opened like a crescent moon, and my gaze is that of a blood-hungry beast.

My trained skills wonâ€™t fade, but my soul has been tainted, and my limbs have turned into weapons.

My friend, you shall not see my face, as this helmet remains the only proof of my knighthood.
