A return gift from Arjuna (Alter).

It has neither value as an object of magecraft or a piece of art. Rather, it has merely been polished to be beautiful. It’s really up to you to determine its value.
Is it an insignificant imitation jewel?
Or is it a treasured gift from a special friend?

As long as it remains beautiful, it doesn’t matter what value others may assign to it.
