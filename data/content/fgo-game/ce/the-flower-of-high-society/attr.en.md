As the light of the ball was about to be extinguished, she finally arrives.
Lustrous hair, lips pouted like a bud, and pale skin that is almost translucent.
She is like a painting come to life.
She may be foreign in our country, but she is a fully bloomed flower that stands silently, proudly.

While everyone else holds their breath,
a young seaweed-haired man who cannot read the room shouts:

“Don’t you think she’s too tall?
She’s totally not my type.”

What was the fate of the young man?
The other gentlemen who attended the ball all had satisfied looks on their faces, and never spoke of the situation ever again.
