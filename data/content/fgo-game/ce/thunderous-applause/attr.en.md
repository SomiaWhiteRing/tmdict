“O heaven, let ye construct, and show thy supreme light.”

The name of the theatre is Domus Aurea.
It’s an imaginary heaven decorated with a crimson awning and gold.
But, it is more than something beautiful.
Glorious days, cruel betrayals, merciless misunderstandings, and even unrealized blessings.
She loved them all, and praised their beauty.

The applause wasn’t for the heroine on the stage, but for the life of everyone who was there.
