The great Pharaoh Ozymandias had shouted out to me during the race…

I just realized those were words of encouragement and cheers!

As proof, please take a look. No, you MUST look!
Look at all these details!
It’s basically the scarab that I used during the race, but take a good, good, good, GOOD look! It says “Ramesseum Tentyris”!

This can mean only one thing…
Fufu…fufufufu… Don’t make me spell it out.
But I will!
I have received a reward!!!
