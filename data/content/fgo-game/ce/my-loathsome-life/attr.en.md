There was a time where skills were required to be an executioner.
The executioner needed skills to instantly decapitate the sinners, painlessly, out of respect for one’s mind.

We don’t have to trouble ourselves over that anymore.
Anyone can become an executioner, without any pain.
Cruel punishments also become obsolete.
…In other words, now a great deal of people can be executed in an efficient way.
That’s about it.

I was foolish then, and I didn’t realize it.
When the aristocrats wanted to execute a young and innocent girl, I should’ve destroyed the guillotine there and then.

I… just didn’t want anybody to suffer.
