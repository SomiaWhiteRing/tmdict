The princess who lives in the castle of darkness begins her day by throwing exquisite sweet rice balls in the shape of bush clovers, befitting her beautiful appearance, into her small mouth.

By the time the sun reaches its zenith and readies to set, she sends those sweets as soft and velvety as a sensual body down her throat like little candied boats to the sea.

And later, as she gazes at the sky curtain full of twinkling stars, she lovingly adores the sweets like peering through a northern window, until she tires of it, to end her day.

Ah…what decadent beauty, O princess of destruction.
Your destiny starts with red bean paste and ends with red bean paste.
Just like the fate of our DR Empire… (Harp flourish)
