Summer is over. Vacation is over.
All those memories just feel empty now that it’s all done.
Yes, things come and go, just like these quiet waves.
I wish upon the sun.
Please, stop sinking over the horizon.
Just a few minutes more, no, just a year more, let this moment continue.

“Just kidding! Now’s not the time for sad poems like that!
Even if summer is ending, Tamamo-chan’s summer isn’t over until the sun finishes setting!
I’m going to keep having fun until the last second!”

…The summer beast is an immortal animal.
So don’t worry, next year’s summer also promises sparkling days☆
