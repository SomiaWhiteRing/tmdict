Valentine’s gift from Avicebron.

Chocolate mini golems that amble cutely about. They leave a delicious, chocolate-scented trail and are hugely popular among children. The problem is…well, they’re inedible. Even so, the golems often have bite marks, and the oni behind it remains at large.

???: “You got it wrong…it’s not me!”
