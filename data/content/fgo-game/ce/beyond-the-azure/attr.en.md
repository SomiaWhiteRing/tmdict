The secret technique book of the Jet Tennen Rishinryu, a sword style from a backwater galaxy that nobody from any Singularity or heretical land has ever heard of.

As I impart to you this secret technique today, memories of my painful and rigid days of training return. Yet they are not all painful memories. Those sparkling, dazzling, bustling, fun times spent in a foreign land were but a fleeting summer memory to me. The time I fought against a mysterious demonic king, Master and I (where I was their martial arts master) formed a wonderful united front, the secret technique finally coming into its own after evading many life-threatening crises, a watermelon that exploded and made a mess from a game of watermelon splitting, overcooked yet still delicious yakisoba, shaved ice that dyed the tongue all blue… Oh, I’m sorry, I digress.

That’s right. No words need to be exchanged between Master and I. Now, speaking as your master in martial arts, you must inherit my legacy that is this ultimate technique to become a true samurai who will tear through the Milky Way.

…To go beyond the cloudless blue sky.





Eh? You don’t want it? WHY NOT!?
