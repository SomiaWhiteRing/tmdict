I know it’s a little late, but still let me explain.

The Heaven Scorcher Halberd is General Lu’s only partner and what makes him special.
It is truly a masterpiece, and the only thing that was allowed in his heart, the heart of a man who claimed he needed no friend and no comrade.
Slash, thrust, strike, sweep, repel.
The weapon utilizes all the qualities that you can find in a two-handed weapon, an almighty and all-purpose weapon, if I may say so myself.
Many people may say, well isn’t that because the General wasn’t skilled enough to switch weapons depending on the ever-changing battlefield?
I say to those people, you are just jealous of the General’s talent in martial arts.
The simple truth is, if he has the time to switch weapons, he might as well use that time to destroy more enemies.
Isn’t that a form of courage that’s worthy of his nickname the Flying General?

Well, this weapon actually originated from the Northern Song Dynasty, and it shouldn’t exist in a time where Lu Bu was alive.
Then why is he holding that weapon you ask?
That’s because I went ahead before it’s time and secretly developed the weapon.
