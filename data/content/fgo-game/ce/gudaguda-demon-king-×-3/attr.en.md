“I’m the original Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga!”

“And I’m the hero of Owari who rose to greatness during the changing and turbulent times, Oda Kippoushi!”

“And I am the true Demon King, Oda Nobunaga…”

So…which Nobunaga’s the strongest?

“That’s me!” “Me!” “It is obviously me.”

This is the start of the All-Out Nobunaga Great Battle of the Warring States! Ready… Fight!

“By the way, if it’s ×3, wouldn’t that mean it’s three times as effective or stronger? Eh? That’s not how it works? …Oh I see.”
