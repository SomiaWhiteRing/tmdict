Once, Buddha was invited by a king, and welcomed grandly.
The feast lasted until nightfall, and Buddha’s path home fell dark.

The king extravagantly placed torches along the entire path, but a single gale blew them all out.

Despite this, one faint light still illuminated Buddha’s path.
It was one of a poor old man who couldn’t prepare a gift, whose social status would not allow him to attend the feast…
It was a gift made from the bottom of the beggar’s heart.

It’s true that admiration, and many desires are what makes life interesting.
But it is that one sincere deed that no one notices, which brings happiness to life.
