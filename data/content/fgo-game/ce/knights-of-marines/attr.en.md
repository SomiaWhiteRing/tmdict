Even if their destination was the endless open sea, it was fine as long as there were friends that understood, appreciated, and competed with each other.

“By the way, Sir Lancelot, do you know how to swim?”
“But of course. If I take off my armor, I could swim across the Strait of Dover. What about you, Sir Gawain?”
“I do not have any experience in swimming against the ocean current, but I have crossed a river in the middle of a storm before.”
“I can see both of you are skilled. But I do not like getting wet, so I would avoid the water unless a woman was drowning. Yet, the master at swimming within the Round Table would be…”
