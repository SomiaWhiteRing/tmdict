Olga.
Tatiana.
Maria.
Anastasia.
Take the first letter of each of our names to spell OTMA.
An acronym…our little secret.
Even if we get married and have children…even if we drift apart, that we are sisters will never change.
Let’s never fight, ever.
Let’s never hate each other.
And let’s pray to God that we can live good, fulfilling lives…

Yes, I know.
That wish never came true.
Our prayers were never answered.

Ah, yes…at least one of those wishes did come true.
We were still together when we died.
