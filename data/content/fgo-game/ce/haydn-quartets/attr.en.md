My music is supreme beauty, but my life, well, to put it lightly, was crap.

I ignored my friends for music, and I failed to be human for music.

But there were times where I was somewhat human.
These are the few vestiges of my humanity.
My beautiful Haydn.
My wonderful Haydn.
“I will acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and aim for them myself.”
I still remember the two years I clung to that obvious happiness and thought that.
