This place has too much fun stuff.

She hands you a notebook decorated with colorful stickers. It’s unclear whether what she’s written, filling the notebook cover to cover, is actually of any value, but one thing’s for sure: the words are very much from the current version of her.

Things she liked…things she disliked…
Places she visited for the very first time…the people she met…
The person she holds dear to this day…
And so many other things…

“Don’t show this to anyone else.”

She gently smiles as she says that.
