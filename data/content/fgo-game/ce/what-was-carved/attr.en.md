An absolute god is omnipotent, excels in all areas, and possesses all kinds of Authority. I may currently be used as a Servant whose purpose is to fight, but the fact that I am a god remains unchanged. Or at least, there shouldn’t have been a change. And yet…

You wished for me to act like myself. That’s why I made this crudely carved doll to remind myself of your words. I took a tree branch and started carving it with a knife, and shaped it little by little… And now this little doll that I made has become so dear to me.

Even if it isn’t perfect, I still made this incomplete little thing with my own hands. No matter how minute it is, this is the feeling of pride that an omnipotent god could never feel.
