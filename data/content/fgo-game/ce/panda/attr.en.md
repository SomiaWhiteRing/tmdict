Valentine’s Day chocolate from Qin Liangyu.

I may be tooting my own horn, but don’t you think these chocolates are adorable!? Awww, honestly it’s even a bit of a shame to eat them. Please at least take a picture before you do, so you have something to remember how cute they are.

I know! Why don’t we name these four? Huh? If we do that, it’ll feel wrong to eat them? Hmm, you have a point there, Master…
