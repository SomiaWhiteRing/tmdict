Everything began here.
My life was filled with sorrow, love, hatred, and joy.
I grieved that I could not be with the ones I loved, and I loved developing stronger bonds from the bottom of my heart.
I felt both respect and hatred towards my inhuman king, but even so – I was filled with joy.

There’s so much I lost. So much I did wrong. So many people I hurt.
And there were things I gained, things I believed were right, and things I protected.

But there’s been enough of all that.
The time has come to leave it all behind.
I’m a little tired.
I’ll take off my armor, take off my helmet, throw down my sword…
And I’ll sleep for a while.
Here, in this lake, where it’s so peaceful.
Just for a little… just for a little while.
