A good Master should have sound mind and spirit, but they must also have a healthy physique.

However, because humans are swamped with burdens (tasks), they tend to neglect this fundamental need.

But!
If you have a brilliant trainer who can create a reasonable training regimen, thereâ€™s no doubt YOU can become a top Master!
