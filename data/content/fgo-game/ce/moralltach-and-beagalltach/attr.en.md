When embarking on an adventure where life and death hang in the balance, take the demonic blade Móralltach and the demonic spear Gáe Dearg. Should the risk appear nothing more than in days of peace, take the demonic blade Beagalltach and demonic spear Gáe Buidhe. It is in this way that Diarmuid was said to have used his equipment for different occasions during his life as a Knight of Fianna. Now that he wields both demonic swords, what must he think of his manifestation?

The answer is quite clear. He must simply continue to behave as a knight should.

If he cannot wield both blade and spear as he did while he lived, then all he must do is serve his Master and always be prepared for battle. No matter his Spirit Origin, he must simply dedicate himself to discharging his duty.
