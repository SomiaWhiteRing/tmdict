Valentine’s return gift from Cú Chulainn (Caster).

Whether due to his reserved nature as a sage of the forest, or his innate stubbornness, he has no intention of cozying up to others by offering a return gift.
Then again, he did make a completely new staff to help make the forest trail easier, so maybe he does care…
