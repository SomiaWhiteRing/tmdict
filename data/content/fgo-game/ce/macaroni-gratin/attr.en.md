Valentine’s return gift from Arthur Pendragon.

It’s steaming hot.
It’s gratin straight out of the oven.

The cheese and macaroni are store-bought, but the cream sauce is homemade.
This may be news to you, but he’s actually really good at cooking.

What?

Did macaroni gratin exist in fifth century Britain, you ask? Or does the Holy Grail also give Servants knowledge of recipes?

It is neither.
He might actually tell you by the time you finish eating it.
He might tell you about memories and knowledge that have been irregularly passed down…such as the Holy Grail War from a different world.

…So, eat up, for now.
…Before this oven-fresh gratin gets cold!
