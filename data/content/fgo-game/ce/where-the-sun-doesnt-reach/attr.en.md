…There’s such a thing as the Origin.

It’s not complicated. I just mean it in the literal sense.
What did you start from?
What were you born from?
Your mother? No.
I don’t mean you as an individual. I mean you as something that exists.

Some people were born from “swords.”
I’m sure some people were born from “worthlessness.”

My Origin?
You’ve already seen it. …Cut, and connect.
It can be used as a normal attack, but it’s my second Noble Phantasm.
Phantasm Punishment. The manifestation of cutting and connecting.
It’s my Origin given form.
