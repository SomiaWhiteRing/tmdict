The legend speaks.
Kings are noble, holy, and unreachable.
As a promising and fulfilling tomorrow awaits.
The stars speak.
Eras will change, rules will change.
The age of kingship will one day come to an end.

The crown shines brightly atop one accepting of the truth.
Even if one shall never be rewarded, and even if the ideal shall never be realized.
