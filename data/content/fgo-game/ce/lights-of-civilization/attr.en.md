Failure after failure.
I heave a sigh at the pathetic results.
I drink my reheated coffee.
I go for a walk.
I think of a different material.
In high spirits, I secure some.
Experiment.
Another failure.
“Perhaps such a thing doesn’t exist in this world.”
“Perhaps a light bulb can never stay lit.”
I embrace the thought… then crush the life from it.
I’d only tried 8,000 so far.
There are more than 10,000 other materials in this world.
I’ll try them all, and if I can’t find something that works, I’ll discover a new one.
As my doubts piled up, I shook them off as I walked.

“Now, what’s next? Perhaps Japanese bamboo?”
