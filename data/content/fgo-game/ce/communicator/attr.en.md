Gift from Mecha Eli-chan.

A communicator for sending out commands to Mecha Eli-chan.
As Mecha Eli-chan does not eat chocolate, she does not give out chocolates.
It is coveted by pilots everywhere, since it protects Master’s head and it is able to keep in touch with Mecha Eli-chan.

“This is far too good for you, but I’m sure there will be a day when you are worthy of it. Until that time comes, make sure to practice every day. Practice what, you ask!? Isn’t it obvious? You need to practice an awesome-looking command pose fit for the big screen!”
