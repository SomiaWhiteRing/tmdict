Do you know of ■?
The shape of ■. The strength of ■.
The color of ■. The aroma of ■.
The effects of ■. The crime of ■.
The horror of ■. The pleasure of ■.

It can be salvation.
It can be death.

The god who possessed this arrow knew too much of ■ and got too close to ■, and so grew weary of it. Soon, she began to despise, look down on, and ridicule all things. But in a strange way, this meant she showed concern for all things. This god is defined by her hatred of everything other than herself, but also her ■ of everything other than herself.
Though, put differently, it could also mean:

She cannot ■ herself.

Let’s make seemingly happy humans unhappy…
Let’s watch unhappy humans grow even more unhappy…
Let’s stir up people’s relationships and wreak havoc.
Let’s enjoy this sadistic bliss…like slowly torturing people to death…
Come, let’s shoot use this beautiful flower arrow to play the role of a cruel Cupid.

The above was a most well-reasoned thought process, to be sure. It was the only manner in which this god could involve herself with anything concerning ■.

And yet…
The fact that she doesn’t try to stop herself from getting involved in the first place could perhaps mean…
She might be anticipating…
She might be waiting for this illusory concept that, for all its abundance in the unicerse, seems not to exist within her.
She might be waiting for the moment when someone is able to offer it to her.

And that’s why she asks:

“Do you know of ■?”
You are likely the only person who has the ability, and is in a position to provide the god with this one thing she lacks. Knowing this, are you familiar with its brilliance and splendor?

If so, and if you are able to provide this jaded god with it…perhaps something might develop within this god who does not know of ■.
