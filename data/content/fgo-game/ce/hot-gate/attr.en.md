We will die here. That is our fate.
A general is given his soldiersâ€™ lives, and a general must, in return, give everything he has to bring victory to them.
However, this is a battle we cannot win.
This is a battle which leads to tomorrow, one which will bring our brethren victory as they step over our corpses.
But is it okay for us to take this path?
Do any of you not value your own lives?
The soldiers laughed off my worries with all of their hearts.
Very well, let us protect this gate! For honor, for courage, for love; we protect, we fight, and we die!
