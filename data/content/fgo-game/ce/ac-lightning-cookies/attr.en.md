Valentine’s return gift from Nikola Tesla.

Lots of freshly baked cookies.
Tesla’s face is drawn on the cookies.
Just between you and me, these cookies are uncannily similar to the cookies Edison baked.

Gentleman & Lion: “Why!? Was it because we used exactly the same ingredients and followed the same recipe!?”
Helena: “Why else would it be? Besides, I’M the one who taught you two how to bake the cookies and decorated them!”
