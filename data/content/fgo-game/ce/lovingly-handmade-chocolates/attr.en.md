Valentine’s chocolates from Illyasviel von Einzbern.

♪Illya burned the cho-co-late.
Cho-co-late, cho-co-late.
Illya worked all through the night…
And this is what survived♪
This was the only one that turned out okay, so please enjoy it.
Make a promise with Ruby, okay?
You know, Illya having fun in Chaldea is all thanks to you, Master.
Here’s a Cacao Beam from Ruby too, as a sign of gratitude☆
