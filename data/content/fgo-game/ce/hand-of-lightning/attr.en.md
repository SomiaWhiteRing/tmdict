An unparalleled genius.
A modern day Prometheus.
A handsome man with no equal.
A man that brought Zeus’ lightning to Earth.
A worthy rival of the King of Inventors, Edison.
A character who would boast that he could even split the stars.

He was a real genius.
The army of devices he wears as a Heroic Spirit demonstrates this fact further.
