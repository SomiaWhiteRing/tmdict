It doesn’t matter if you are a man or woman, the death of a pirate is brutal.
That’s why they both fought to the bitter end.
They fired their guns, swung their cutlasses, screamed with all their might, bathed in their enemies’ blood, just like two berserkers on the battlefield.
Those in command of them, those that called themselves pirates, did not fight as bravely as they did.
They enjoyed taking, but weren’t prepared to be taken.
Those cowards hid on their ship, trembling, like a bunch of losers.
There were only two pirates on the ship of Calico Jack - Mary Read and Anne Bonny.
