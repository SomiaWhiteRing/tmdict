Let me tell you a story.

Ever since his own birth, the man has always been unsatisfied.
Pain, itchiness, dullness, swelling.
His body was filled with these feelings all over like a lice infection.
He believed in words instead of intuitions, and stories over emotions.
Therefore, the man was not at peace with himself.
It doesn’t matter if it’s the grievance of the oppressed, or if it’s the joy of the unworthy neighbors.
Everything seems to be full of unbearable discontentment.
The man said, “I’m like a cat swarmed by lice.”
All of my worries, you laughed them off as if they were simply something insignificant.

This was what happened on one sunny, yet very ordinary day.
