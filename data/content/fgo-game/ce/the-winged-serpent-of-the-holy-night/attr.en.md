Merry Christmas!
Merry Sambamas!
Feliz Navidad!

As shouts of joy (and the rhythm of samba) fill the holy night, winged serpents are busy delivering presents. They may not have antlers, nor do they walk on all fours, but they are Santa’s helpers, and so qualify as reindeer.

“Okay. Next up, we’ll head to the Australian continent via the Antarctic, and continue on towards Asia! There’s still plenty of people who need our presents and the fun of the season! Just you wait, my lovely humans!”
And with this command from the lively and brightly colored Santa, the ancient pterosaurs fly off into the snowy night sky.

That any of this happened at all is a miracle unto itself.
