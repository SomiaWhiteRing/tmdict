“I’ll never forgive you, for as long as I live. You know why?
Because thanks to you, I now know there’s another, happier world out there.

So stand up, dammit. Stand up and fight for it.
Go on and brag about how you can smile in your world, and tell us why it should be the one to survive.

Be proud. Hold your head up high, and fight for your weak little world.

…Don’t you dare go losing to a world like this, a world whose only virtue is strength!”

This is but a vision of a dream.
A world that would never be possible, only dreamed of by a Yaga.
Yet, you still imagine it….you still envision a wolf looking up at the stars, grinning in satisfaction.
