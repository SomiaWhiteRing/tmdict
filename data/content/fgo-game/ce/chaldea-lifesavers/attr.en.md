“As long as a life can be saved, we are prepared to do anything. That’s right, anything!”

The summer ocean is full of dangers. Today, it may be a place to escape the heat and cool down, but if you have a problem like sharks, jellyfish, or heatstroke, and you can find them, maybe you can hire a team that will protect you from all of those dangers! A crack unit of wonderful lifesavers!

First is Ushiwakamaru!
She’s an expert at sailing the rescue ship, the Babbage! But keep it a secret that she’s faster when jumping across the water!
Next is Jack!
She’s the best at treating any injuries. Call her right away if you’re attacked by sharks. Tonight we’ll have shark fin soup!
Last is Nightingale!
She can basically do anything, but she overdoes it completely! You’d think she’d give CPR to resuscitate someone, but instead she grabs the heart directly!
But she ain’t gettin’ on no plane, fool!
