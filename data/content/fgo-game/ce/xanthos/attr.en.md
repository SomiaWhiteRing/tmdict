Valentine’s gift from Achilles…?

A divine horse that Achilles received as a gift from his father. It hardly speaks, but when it does, it picks at the most inopportune times.

“They say anybody who gets in the way with another’s love affairs gets kicked in the butt by a horse. But if you’re a horse already, you won’t get kicked, now will ya? Neigh, neigh, neigh!”

…Since it is said in such a mean, maniacal way, it’s best that Master be mindful of human and (Demi) Servant relationships.
