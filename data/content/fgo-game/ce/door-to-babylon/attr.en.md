The vault that holds all treasures on earth.
Also called the “Gate of the Gods.”
The legendary treasure vault of Babylon itself.

At the grave of Assyrian Queen Nitocris, it is said there hides the door leading to such a vault.
Although the many Kings of Babylon would never touch it, a great king opened the door without hesitation.

Herodotus wrote, “There was nothing in the grave.”
Didn’t the king obtain a vast amount of wealth?
Or did the king bring prosperity upon his nation through politics alone?

At least the king’s descendants were wealthy.
Therefore, many battles were waged upon such a notion.
