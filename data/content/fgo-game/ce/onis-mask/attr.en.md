Whoever puts on this mask becomes an oni.
So you really can’t put it on unless you absolutely need to…
Of course, that’s just a joke told during a night of drinking.
This is just a normal mask. It doesn’t turn you into an oni.

Oh, but if I could put this on, if I could become an oni…
If I could become a monster and slay all my foes…
If it could save myself from my suffering…
I think I would…

And then, after wearing the mask, I understood.
I did indeed become an oni.
Just by hiding my face, I am capable of all wickedness and evil deeds.

I cannot remove this oni mask anymore.
As I embrace evil, the Fuuma within me degenerates as well.
I’m sorry, father.
I have been reduced to nothing but an oni.
