Clad in extravagant clothing, we set forth to a party located far out into the ocean.

Dazzling treasures? Of course, there are tons.
The sound of gunshots? Of course, I get sick of it everyday.
Top-shelf booze to warm your chest? Of course, plenty of that after we win!

What, there’s not enough beautiful women to pick from?
Well that’s because…
Most women ran away when they saw the Captain!
