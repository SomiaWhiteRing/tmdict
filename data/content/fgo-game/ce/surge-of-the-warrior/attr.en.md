Oh, there you are, Master!
Actually, I’m looking for something.
I think I left a small red vial around here.
Have you seen it?
It’s not irreplaceable, but it wouldn’t be a good idea if a youth or human drank it without knowing about it.

……Oh, you seem to be interested.
What? In a way, it’s the proof of a brave warrior.
It’s the secret among secrets that we, the Red Branch Knights received from the druids, a gem coveted even by those from Connacht!
A single sip will bring even a warrior whose body is lined with the wounds of battle back to his full vigor!
It’s effective for both on the battlefield and in the bed!
If you can pass the Luck check, that is!

Well, these days, people refer to it as an “energy drink.”

You ask what happens if you fail the Luck Check?
Well, then……
Wait, don’t tell me you drank it……?
