Let’s take a look in the pot. Inside is a sea of sweet melted chocolate.

Let’s eat our fill together, along with all the friends we love.

Valentine’s Day is like a sandcastle built in the path of an oncoming wave: only a little ever remains, and only in memory.

The wonderful tea party will come and go, but we all hope everyone will have sweet and wonderful memories.
