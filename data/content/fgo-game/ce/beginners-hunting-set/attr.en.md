A return gift from William Tell.

A hunting set perfect for beginners given its ease of use and many safety measures. Novice hunters can easily capture prey using thisâ€¦ Well, not really. Just a quick but firm reminder that hunting is no easy feat.

But as long as you equip this and follow the directions of your reliable senior hunter, you should be able to return home from the mountains unscathed.

You may return from your first hunting trip with nothing more than exhaustion to show for it, but that is part of the charm of hunting.
