Valentine’s return gift from Yan Qing.

You can attack with it, defend with it, or hide behind it.
It is elegant, to boot.

Hide this up your sleeve, and when you get surrounded by enemies, pull the fan out and open it up.

What do you think? Isn’t it chock full of romance and chivalry?
Well, the only flaw is that it’s a bit heavy…
To fix that, we’ll just have to train together!
