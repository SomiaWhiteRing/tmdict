To welcome morning, what was necessary was a tale. Words. Pleasure. Innocence. Calculation. A smile. A lie. Observation. Instinct. Imagination. Knowledge. Slumber. The bravery of my smart sister. The fear of death. Weakness that would not let me put a knife to his throat. Weakness that would not let me put a knife to my own throat.

I put them all to use…and finally…finally…morning came like a miracle.

And then night comes once again.
