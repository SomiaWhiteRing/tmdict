When the army of random dragons attacked, France was on the verge of ruin. The last stronghold of humanity had fallen. Would mankind be forced to endure the sounds of breathing that are deafeningly akin to ultrasonic waves every day?
Ah, but hope remains in HER! With the iron-shelled dragon Tarasque as a booster and the teachings of the Lord as ammunition, the Saint of the Iron Fist, Martha, descends upon the land!

“Alter Ego? I don’t care…bring it on! Let’s let our fists do the talking, and I’ll show you who the true Iron Dragon is!”
