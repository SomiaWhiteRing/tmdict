Understanding, empathy, I myself, a lover… They’re all unnecessary, the girl cried out.
If I’m going to be hated anyway, then everything might as well disappear!

But the memories from the past embraced her lonely heart.
Even if the world is filled with pain, there must be a heart somewhere that wants to save it.

“That’s right. I have learned of love.
Even if it doesn’t come true, or if we never meet, there must be someone who shone upon my heart.
Even if it does not pay off, such love is not a thing to be sad about.”

She won’t look away from the mirror anymore.
Even if they could never touch one another, for the sake of the person she’d fallen in love with, she would blossom like a flower. That was the girl’s dearest wish.
