There exists a natural evil at the end of this.
There exists a devourer of men, a Minotaur.
As he tries to hide his fear, a man proceeds through the labyrinth with what little courage he has.

He thinks he might die here.
He thinks he might be lost in here forever.
He thinks he might get eaten by the Minotaur.

However, he didn’t know the monster was a human…
A human boy who desperately tries to be punished as a monster.

The end is nigh for the both of them.
