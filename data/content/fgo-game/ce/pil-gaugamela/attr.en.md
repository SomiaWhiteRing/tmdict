Valentine’s return gift from Darius III.

A war elephant said to have been used during the Battle of Gaugamela.
Even His Majesty, who has a massive frame, can comfortably ride on it.
It’s not the war elephant of death that appears in his Noble Phantasm, but a real elephant bedecked in the finery of the Achaemenid Empire.

Now, come. Let’s go and enjoy a “drive” with His Majesty.
