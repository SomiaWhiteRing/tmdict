Valentine’s return gift from Christopher Columbus.

Boiled eggs neatly lined up.
None of them have their ends crushed.
The important part is that one should never give up.

All who meet him, including you, ask him the same thing:
“Is the story of the egg really true?”
“What’s the point if you crush the egg?”
Normally, he would laugh off the question with a dumbfounded look, but this time around, he is denying the accusation in a more specific way by offering a return gift he made specially for you.

The eggs themselves are not the important part, but rather his conviction that he puts forth.
It’s proof that his beliefs are sincerely held.

No matter how much time it takes, no matter how many times you fail…as long as you keep going and never give up, your dreams will one day come true.
