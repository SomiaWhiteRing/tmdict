### Bond 2

Her True Name is “Yang Yuhuan.”
She’s like your pretty childhood friend with unparalleled qualities…probably? Someone in her family would enter her into a beauty pageant without her knowing, which would result in her becoming really popular, yet somehow she would remain oblivious to her fame.

She is versed in singing, dancing, and playing the pipa. She also dearly loves hot springs and lychee. She is straightforward and positive. She works hard and takes joy in serving those with whom she is intimate.

During the three hundred years of the Tang Dynasty’s rule, she became a concubine to Emperor Xuanzong at the dynasty’s height. Xuanzong was the grandson of Wu Zetian, making her Yang Guifei’s grandmother-in-law…at least that is their technical relationship, but mention that at your peril.
