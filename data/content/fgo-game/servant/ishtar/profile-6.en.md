### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Return to Chaldea」

In FGO she has manifested as a Pseudo-Servant possessing a human.
Ishtar has a very strong ego, and behaves in ways that generally disregard the person she’s possessing, yet her personality has been highly affected by her vessel this time.
Ishtar is both compassionate and cruel, but since the person she’s possessing tends more towards good than evil, her cruelty has taken a back seat and her good aspects have come to the surface.

To Ishtar, a Master is somebody fun to tease. As a goddess, she considers herself superior, but since her personality is based on the person she’s possessing, she never looks down on mankind. Simply put, she treats them with love and friendship as “toys that are fun to tease.”
But as bonds deepen, her caring and empathetic nature changes her opinion from “a toy that’s fun to tease” to “an important contractor, who is worthy of watching over.”
