### Bond 2

He’s a wild but cool kind of guy.
Even though he won’t judge between justice or evil and decide which one is better, he cares deeply about being just in the world.
But he isn’t mature enough to accept the many unfairnesses that occur in the world.
He’s a creature tamer, and has a great affinity for dogs.
