Creator of the Great Plains.
Summons the giant “Coyote” of the Apaches.
As soon as he is summoned, the “Sun,” who had his tobacco stolen by him, begins to chase after him and cause powerful solar damage in a wide area.
At the same time, Coyote, in his role as guardian, amplifies the power of Geronimo’s allies.
