### Bond 2

#### Bloody Devil: B

He has a history of battle you would never expect to find in a Caster.
A master of the bow, spear, knife, and other weapons. He gains a bonus to melee combat.

A talented warrior, itâ€™s said that his desire for revenge burned so brightly that even after his spear broke, he continued fighting the Mexican army with a knife, covering himself in his own blood and that of his foes.
