### Clear Interlude 「Heroic Spirit of the Charity」

Karna accepts everything as “it happens,” and is a Servant who’s extremely generous.
He treats everyone equally, and respects everyone equally.
Although it was never publicly acknowledged due to prejudice, Karna’s caliber as a martial artist and dignity as a person can be ranked one of the highest amongst all Servants.

Although it’s quite impossible, if you are in a contract with this Servant and still can’t win, then either you are not fit for combat, or you have issues handling elites.
