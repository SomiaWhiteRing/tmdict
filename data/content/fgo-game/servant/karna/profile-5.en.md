### Bond 5

According to the legend, Karna gave his golden armor to Indra.
In exchange for giving up and dismantling his armor, Karna received a lance powerful enough to slay even gods.
It is said this lance of light cannot be wielded by even the King of Gods.
When this lance is clad with crimson blood, one strike, just one strike, is said to be able to cleanse all impurities.

--Vasavi Shakti.
