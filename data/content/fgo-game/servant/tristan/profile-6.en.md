### Clear Interlude 「It Begins with Loss」

King Arthur was a respectable king, impartial and sincere, so much so that there remained no room for human emotion to get in the way.
Seeing the king’s endless self-denial in continuing to lead and fight for Camelot was heartbreaking. That it was so honorable, so righteous, only made it all the more tragic.
Tristan’s psyche could no longer stand such human suffering. His parting words when he left the Round Table became a curse on many of his fellows, and unbeknownst to him, even upon the king:

“Our king does not understand the human heart.”
