### Bond 5

One day, Tristan fell to poison in a certain battle, and near death, he sought to see Iseult one more time.
“If she is coming, raise a white sail. If she is not, a black sail…”
As Tristan waited for the ship carrying Iseult, his wife Iseult whispered to him.
“A ship with a black sail is headed this way.”
With this small treason - this lie - against her husband who never tried to love her despite their marriage, the curtains closed on the tale of Tristan.
