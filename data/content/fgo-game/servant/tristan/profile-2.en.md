### Bond 2

Tristan was the child of Rivalen, King of Leonois, and Blancheflor, the younger sister of Mark, Prince of Cornwall. However, his circumstances were fit to call him “Child of Sadness.”
To begin with, his father Rivalen died in battle without ever being able to see Tristan’s face.
His mother Blancheflor passed away shortly after giving birth and naming her child Tristan, entrusting him to Loire, a loyal subordinate of Rivalen.
