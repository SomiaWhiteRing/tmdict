### Bond 2

The king of Britain, Altria Pendragon’s other self as an Alter…has awakened to yet another belief.
With summer approaching, instead of being a tyrant, Altria thought to reflect on her role by becoming a helper. What she’s saying is understandable, but how she came to that conclusion is a complete mystery. She may have chosen the path of a maid because she wanted to make Master’s summer better.
She is trying to hide the fact that she is Altria, so much of her equipment is disguised.

Excalibur is a mop.
Secace is a gun.
Her battle style is more militant.
She mows down enemies with her mop, stops them with her gun, and blows stuff up with her grenades.
Yeah…like…a maid…
