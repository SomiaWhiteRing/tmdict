### Bond 4

#### Independent Action: EX

A skill that allows her to move even without her Master.
She may have a lord she should be serving, but that’s a separate issue.
A maid is meant to serve freely… This should be done with initiative, and not commanded by another. And her thinking this way is pretty much how she got the Independent Action skill. By acquiring this skill, her normal parameters have slightly decreased.

#### Summer Sweeper!: A

The Mana Burst skill that changed into something more appropriate for the help. An expert in washing away anyone and anything.
While her own power to serve (ATK) goes up, she sternly supervises the entire party to raise up morale.

#### Coaching: A

Altria Alter by the sea is also a cold-hearted governess (female tutor). With her tough teaching and directing style, she is able to correct any faulty battle style. As it’s a tough-as-nails skill, those she coaches will sustain great damage.
