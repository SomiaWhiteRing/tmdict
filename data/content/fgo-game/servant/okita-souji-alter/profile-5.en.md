Absolute Sword, Endless in Three Stages.
Endless includes the following three components: vastness, freedom, and boundlessness.
The ultimate demonic sword that emits a shining black light wielded by Majin Okita Souji.
It has the ability to annihilate anything that should not or must not exist in this world. To perform this attack, Okita needs her specialized sword, Rengokuken, the Sword of Purgatory.

The name Rengokuken was arbitrarily given to the sword as it was originally an unknown armament left unsigned by its smith. For some reason, it seems to possess a will, and its performance changes drastically depending on the mood of the wielder. When the wielder is in good shape and a good mood, the center of the sword glows red. It seems the sword has taken a liking to the name Rengokuken.
