Flame, Burn Even Gods to Ashes.
When Quetzalcoatl left the Aztecs, she burned her own palace so that the evil god Tezcatlipoca could not steal her many treasures. This is the reincarnation of those flames.
It burns the surrounding area, and temporarily stops the enemy from releasing the True Name of their Noble Phantasm.

But now that she’s obsessed with lucha libre, it’s become a very strange Noble Phantasm.
She’s turned it into a divine, airborne brainbuster, but in some cases she kicks the enemy from an altitude of a thousand meters. It’s truly like a shooting star strike attack.
Her name for it is Ultimo Topé Patada.
