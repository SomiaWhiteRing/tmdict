### Bond 2

Her name means “Feathered Snake” or “Winged Serpent.”
She is said to have been a benevolent god who refused sacrificial rituals, and considered to be the same being as the avatar of the morning star Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli and the Mayan deity Kukulcan. There are many legends of her goodness, but she is also a fierce god of battle.

Quetzalcoatl led her people to prosperity as a good god, but eventually she was defeated by the god Tezcatlipoca and vanished from the Aztec civilization, leaving behind a prophecy that she would return.

The Aztecs interpreted the Spanish conquerors as the return of Quetzalcoatl and her armies, and were ultimately destroyed.
