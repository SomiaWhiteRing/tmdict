### Bond 3

Originally a male god, she exists as a goddess in this manifestation.
She may have been influenced by the association of the morning star with the goddess of beauty, Venus (Aphrodite).
At least, thatâ€™s what she says.

The gods of South America are very different from gods in other mythologies, and were believed to possess humans in order to perform their work.
Just as there are many Quetzalcoatls in different regions, perhaps in some era the god possessed a female body.
