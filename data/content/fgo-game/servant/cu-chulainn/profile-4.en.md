### Bond 4

#### Runes: B

He possesses Northern European magical crests called Runes.
Warriors in the Land of Shadows excel at many arts, and no warrior is ever raised to  merely thrust a spear…
This is the way his mentor Scáthach thought, so Cú Chulainn is well-versed in Rune spells.
He is close to being a top tier rune user but he thinks the Runes just get in the way, so he does not use them often.
