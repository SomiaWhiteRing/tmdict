### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

When FGO Kiara and CCC Kiara merged, the Mooncell temporarily made BB a Servant as a countermeasure and sent her to the FGO universe (BB, as a user of Void Space, was best suited to subdue Kiara).
Thus, while being a replica of the BB bug, BB was able to act within Seraphix as an autonomous cyber life-form.
The BB who appears in the FGO universe acts just like the little devil of the CCC incident, but to her it feels like that particular experience happened tens of thousands of years ago.
Additionally, she is aware that she is only able to be a Servant in the FGO universe, and does not exist in the original CCC universe. She understands that she is a one-night-only illusion.

BB considers herself not so much a tool for humanity’s salvation as a devil who sometimes leads humanity astray and sometimes helps them out.
“That’s why it’s futile to fall in love with me, okay? No matter how much you fall head over heels with BB, I will never be caught♡”
…Is what she says, looking smug.
