### Bond 5

An AI that has gone rampant, causing “Case CCC.”
She was a supervising AI in the infirmary, but a bug in her command system for self-preservation went out of control. For some reason, she came to the conclusion that “anything can be sacrificed if it means self-preservation.” She then became a continuously growing monster, absorbing NPCs, Servants, and Masters.
She declared that she hates humans, and dragged one Master to the far side of the moon to torture. Her actions are normal to her, but from an objective standpoint, she’s obviously insane.
Even within her own words, contradictions such as excessive love or a mixture of love and hate are easy to spot, but for a full explanation of the cause of those contradictions, you’ll have to refer to Fate/Extra CCC.

Her Luck parameter was the lowest rank, E-, but through efforts (and self-sacrifice) extreme enough to literally twist the world, it became EX.
In other words, she once caused a miracle that only someone with EX-ranked Luck would have been able to achieve.
