### Bond 2

Her words are wicked and spirited, and even if she fumbles her speech or mannerisms, she keeps on plowing ahead. She is the girl pulling all the strings from behind the scenes.
Normally she is a timid girl who seldom takes center stage, but she becomes incessently active for the sake of the one she loves.
She enthusiastically plays the role of villain, but since she doesn’t really have any knowledge or experience of such things, she can’t help but mess up her lines sometimes.

She is aggressive because she has a latent tendency toward sadism. This is the source of her “little devil” persona.
In addition, she is the type of girl who holds back everything until all her built-up frustrations explode at once, so when that happens, she demonstrates horrifying ultra-sadistic behavior.
While she is playing the bad guy, she is on a high, saying things like, “this is SUPER fun!” But once she’s all done and reflects on her behavior afterward when she’s alone, she holds her head in agony.

Though she was the one who created the low-ranking AIs, the Alter Egos, to be her minions to help out in her work, she has terrible relationships with them.
There’s a reason for that: the Alter Egos are not simply copies of BB’s personality but rather AIs that were created based on her personality. This means that each of them has very different opinions from their source material, BB.
That is why Meltryllis and Passionlip are not avatars, but Alter Egos.
