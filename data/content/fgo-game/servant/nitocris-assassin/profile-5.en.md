Rid of Impurities, Blue and Beautiful Nile.
Punish those who show disrespect to the throne of the pharaoh, our king and god.
Death to the evildoings who took the lives of my beloved brothers.
After being appointed as the new puppet Pharaoh by powerful individuals who had low regard for the gods, Nitocris resolved herself to never forgive their disrespect.
After building a giant underground chamber in secret, Nitocris invited the conspirators to a banquet. She then flooded the room with the waters of the Nile, killing them all. And so Nitocris claimed her vengeance.

This story of revenge written in Herodotus’s “The Histories” became Assassin Nitocris’s Noble Phantasm.
In other words, it is a reenactment of her revenge plot, whereby the targets are walled up in a stone chamber which is flooded to kill them all. It is a truly powerful magic similar to a Reality Marble.
