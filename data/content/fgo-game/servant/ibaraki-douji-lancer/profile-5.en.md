In Praise of Folly, Ichijou Modori-bashi.
The Japanese reading would be “Gujinraisan, Ichijou Modori-bashi.” The original Noble Phantasm name is “Breaking Seclusion, Ichijou Modori-bashi.” This is Lancer Ibaraki-Douji’s all-out attack that completely ignores the target’s DEF effects and penetrates Bounded Fields. Remembering the events at Rashomon…or rather, the events at Ichijou Modori-bashi…causes her blood to boil, sending her into a rage and shattering all magecraft defenses protecting her target. During her lifetime, this power enabled her to trick the hated Tsuna into breaking his vow of seclusion and retrieve her severed arm.

This game’s Ibaraki-Douji was defeated by Watanabe-no-Tsuna at both Rashomon and Ichijou Modori-bashi. So she lost to Watanabe-no-Tsuna twice in a row.
