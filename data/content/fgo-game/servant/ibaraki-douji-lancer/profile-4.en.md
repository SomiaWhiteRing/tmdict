### Bond 4

#### Madness Enhancement: D

Ranks up her STR and END parameters, but also eats away at her sanity. This skill carried over from her Berserker form after her change in Spirit Origin. Since it is combined with her oni nature, she’s able to maintain her sanity, meaning it’s possible to hold a normal conversation with her.

#### I’m Not Going Home Yet!: B++

A version of Disengage that underwent an unbelievable evolution.

“It’s already late afternoon, but I don’t wanna go back to the hotel yet! I wanna play at the beach more! I wanna keep playing even after dark! But I guess if everyone’s going home, I don’t have a choice, since playing alone is no fun…”

Ibaraki’s disappointment is immeasurable and her day has manifested as ruined.
