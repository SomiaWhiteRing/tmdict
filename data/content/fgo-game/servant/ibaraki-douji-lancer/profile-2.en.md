### Bond 2

She’s pretty much the Ibaraki-Douji we all know. She apparently doesn’t feel all that different herself. At first glance, one might just think she’s in a slightly better mood, but pointing that out is a good way to get bitten. Oddly enough, were Shuten-Douji to say, “Oh my, look at you. So excitable and fidgety. You are adorable, acting like a little kid. I didn’t think you liked the beach so much.”
…Ibaraki wouldn’t bite.
