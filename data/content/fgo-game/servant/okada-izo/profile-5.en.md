Sword of Settlement.
Man-slayer Izo’s heretical sword. The Noble Phantasm allows the wielder to recreate any sword technique that he has seen, even if only once, and use it as his own.
When summoned initially, he would only know the sword techniques he knew during his lifetime, but as he witnesses other techniques along the way, he has the potential to strengthen himself even more.
However, there is still a limitation on the techniques that he can recreate: they will need to be Anti-Personnel, and anything that is reliant upon special characteristics of the Noble Phantasm cannot be recreated.
