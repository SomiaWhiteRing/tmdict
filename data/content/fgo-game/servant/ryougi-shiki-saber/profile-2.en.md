### Bond 2

The same “Ryougi Shiki” as the one wearing a leather jacket.
However, her personality is different.
If Ryougi Shiki is a girl named “Shiki,” then this person is a woman named “Ryougi Shiki.”
Her origin can be traced back to way before the Ryougi family, the personality of the body that manifested 『　』.
She is not an entity that should roam this world freely, so she will be asleep inside of Shiki from her birth to death.

“Ryougi Shiki” will never be known to Shiki, nor can “Ryougi Shiki” ever replace Shiki.
