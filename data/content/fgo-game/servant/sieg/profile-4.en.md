Scorching Dragon’s Breath, Incinerator of All.
A Noble Phantasm that allows temporary transformation into the dragon Fafnir. He then uses a powerful dragon breath attack to inflict catastrophic damage. This Noble Phantasm originates from his turning into a dragon and flying away in his past life.
According to him, there’s not much difference between being human and being a dragon.
