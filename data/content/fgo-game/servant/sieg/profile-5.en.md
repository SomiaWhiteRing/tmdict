### Bond 5

He has no history of significance.
It may be a bit of a stretch to call him pure, since he was merely resigned to the fact that his purpose was to die. His appearance, intellect, and mindset are similar to a teenagerâ€™s, but he is in fact considered to be a perfect being, quite different from a normal human.

But as he lived on, that perfection began to fall away.

A certain priest detested that aspect of him, but the boy himself embraced his flaws and ultimately abandoned his perfection.
In the end, it was that very conflict that would end the Great Holy Grail War.
