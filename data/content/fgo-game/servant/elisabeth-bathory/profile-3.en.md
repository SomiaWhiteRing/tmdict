### Bond 3

#### Dragon Breath: E

A mana stream unleashed by a dragon, the strongest Phantasmal.
Supersonic dragon’s breath. She uses her skill, Innocent Monster, to turn into a dragon.
But because such a drastic change is difficult, the effect is pretty weak.
She is probably a demi-dragon because the Báthory family crest is a dragon’s tooth.
