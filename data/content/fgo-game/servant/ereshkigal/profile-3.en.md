The Bellows of the Underworld that Trample the Sacred Mountain.

The same as Ishtar’s Noble Phantasm, An Gal Ta Ki Gal Šè. However, Ereshkigal does not hurl her attack from the heavens themselves, but strikes up from the depths of the underworld, rending the land asunder from beneath its surface.
This tremendous blast creates devastating earthquakes and tectonic movement that destroy mount Ebih.
It may not quite have the firepower of Ishtar’s Venus blaster, but the true strength of this Noble Phantasm is that it changes the land, making it part of the underworld. As Ereshkigal has absolute authority within the underworld, all who fight alongside her will receive powerful protection.
