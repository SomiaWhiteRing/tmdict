### Bond 5

Ereshkigal has long been tormented by the fact that no one likes her.
“I want to be able to live freely like Ishtar. I want to meet someone who accepts me for who I am, for being the mistress of the underworld AND for what I am beyond that.”
That was her dearest wish, and sounds rather like what a lovestruck maiden might hope for.
“Look, I won’t deny I’m playing the heel here, but I’m useful to humanity BECAUSE I’m evil! I don’t understand why you’re all so frightened of me!”
Even as she moped about, she saw what was happening in Mesopotamia and realized that it was heading towards its end. So she decided to protect humanity in her own way by joining the Three Goddess Alliance and becoming an enemy of Uruk.

After that, a lot of things happened and she sank into the abyss. Then a lot of others things happened and she chose to accept herself as she is and cooperate with Chaldea’s mission.

The spear that she holds in her hand is called the Burning Shrine, Meslamtaea.
Its light warms the depths of the earth, and was specially granted to her current Spirit Origin.
