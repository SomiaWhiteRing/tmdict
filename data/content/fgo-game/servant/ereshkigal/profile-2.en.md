### Bond 2

According to Mesopotamian mythology, she governed the growth and decay of plants, employed snakes and dragons, and controlled the gallû spirits who were the underworld’s workers.
Ishtar, the mistress of heaven, and Ereshkigal, the mistress of the underworld, are rivals.
For Mesopotamians, Ishtar (Inanna) is the goddess of the harvest and who represents human life: the Great Earth Mother. Ereshkigal, on the other hand, represents the death of all humans, making her the Terrible Earth Mother. 

Myth tells of Ishtar journeying to the underworld, where Ereshkigal kills her.
Later, Ishtar is revived, but the reason for Ishtar’s journey, and why Ereshkigal was so angry are never explained. In FGO, they are described as being two sides of the same coin.
Ishtar and Ereshkigal…
These two gods are one, perhaps even having split off from a single divinity.
