Royal Crown, Light of Wisdom.
A Noble Phantasm that remained unfinished during Caster’s lifetime.
An autonomous Reality Marble that replicates the Primordial Man, Adam, and can continuously repaint the world so long as it exists. However, as with regular golems, certain materials are required for it to maintain its existence.
The giant wields an obsidian sword, and can continue to function even after Caster’s death, as long as its feet touch the ground to grant it the blessing of the earth.
A mage must be used to serve as the golem’s core, and the core’s power and compatibility both affect the giant’s strength.
As a side note, the giant is only about fifteen meters tall when first constructed, but with the magical energy supplied from the earth, it can grow beyond thirty or even sixty meters.
The giant eventually turns into the Garden of Eden itself, transforming the entire world into a peaceful, tranquil place.
