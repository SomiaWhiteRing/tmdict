### Bond 2

A Caster and skilled golem keeper who established the discipline of Kabbalah, which is one of the foundations for magecraft.
Golems can be produced in factories, but to do so requires careful long-term planning and a vast budget (enough to drive a normal mage to bankruptcy ten times over). Still, the resulting golems are about as powerful as an E-rank Servant, and can be manufactured endlessly as long as the budget permits.
However, Avicebron can summon golems of his own accord in battle, though these can only be used temporarily, and are not especially durable.
