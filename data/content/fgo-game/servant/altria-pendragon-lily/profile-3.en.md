### Bond 3

#### Intuition: B

Always “feels” the optimal flow for herself during battle.
Her honed sixth sense is almost precognition.
Reduces the effect of any interference to her sight and hearing.
However, having good hunches is not so good… she acutely picks up the worries of everyone she meets, so she ends up helping each and every person she comes across.
