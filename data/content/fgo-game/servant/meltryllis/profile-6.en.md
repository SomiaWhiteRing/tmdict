### Bond 5

Even though she incorporates others, Meltryllis does not care for the pain or concerns of her victims because she is unable to understand the feelings of others.

People are unnecessary to her.
Love and dreams cannot be shared.
If by chance she truly falls in love, she would likely dote upon and serve the object of her affection to the best of her ability.

As someone utterly self-absorbed, Meltryllis does not consider thinking of what others need.
In a truly oppressive fashion, she asserts that her manner of loving is true and correct.

Thereâ€™s no need for sweet conversation (as at this point, she is already so in love that it is unnecessary), no desire for physical intimacy (as at this point, pleasure of that sort is unsatisfactory), and it is unnecessary to demonstrate that she wants love (as at this point, such communication is superfluous).

Truly a haughty ego that holds nothing.
Beyond her condescending and oppressive attitude is an unclouded and unwaveringly extreme form of love.
