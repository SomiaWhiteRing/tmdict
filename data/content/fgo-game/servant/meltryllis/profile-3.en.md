Benzaiten Gogen Biwa.
As she is not in a proper SE.RA.PH., her primary ability was adjusted to specialize in physical attacks.

Normally it’s not Anti-Personnel, but rather an Anti-Crowd, or Anti-World Noble Phantasm.
It’s not an attack that’s intended to be used against armies or individual soldiers; it is meant to be used on a single civilization that has reached a certain level of culture. Meltryllis’s honey not only breaks down the physical bodies, but also melts the psyche.
This Noble Phantasm melts a community’s common sense and morals into a single colony. And once the physical, mental, and societal groups turn into a slime-like state, her true power is released as she tramples on and absorbs the community.
With her attack more powerful against uncombative opponents, one can see Meltryllis’ true evil seeping out.
