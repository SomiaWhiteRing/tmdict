### Bond 2

Combative, cruel, and sadistic to boot.
She prefers structural beauty and is intolerant of anything ugly.
She is aware that she is a perfect being and considers herself to have accomplished everything, making her extremely prideful.

She looks down on humans and projects a pessimistic, moody persona, behaving as if everything is boring. However, her mannerisms belie her desire to see real beauty.
Meltryllis is an Alter Ego born from a girl’s wish. Thus, deep down she yearns for a Prince Charming of her own, just like Passionlip.

She may be cold, but that is because she is contemplative and logical. She may be cruel, but that is because she observes all things impartially. She may be sadistic, but that is only because, as a caring individual, she meddles continuously in the life of the person she falls in love with.

Since she is aware that she is a monster, she does not believe she can ever get along with humans, and so acts like a monster. But the moment she falls in love with someone, she’ll try to live the life of a prima donna in love by committing herself fully, regardless of whether she is a monster or not.
