### Bond 4

#### Blood-Soaked Brute: A

A skill based on the story of Mori’s hakama pants being soaked red with his victims’ blood. His ATK goes up the more he attacks enemies, but in exchange his DEF goes down.

#### Mental Corruption (Wicked): B

An extraordinary mentality that is demonstrated on the battlefield. Normal communication with others, including his Master, becomes difficult, resulting in him going berserk. His cruelty intensifies, and he will continue to fight until either all enemies are eradicated or he dies himself.

#### Oni Musashi’s Will and Testament: C

The will and testament that Nagayoshi left. Different effects are triggered depending on if this is used as in battle or when incapacitated. This skill is based on the unbelievable story that even his allies rejoiced in his death.
