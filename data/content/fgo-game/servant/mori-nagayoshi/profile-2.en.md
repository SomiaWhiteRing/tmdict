### Bond 2

He is an extremely violent-tempered person, and when a guard at a checkpoint asked him to dismount and state his family name, Mori yelled, “It would be one thing for Lord Nobunaga to give this order, but for YOU to order me, Katsuzo (Mori Nagayoshi), to dismount is unforgiveable!” cut the guard down, threatened to burn down the town if anyone tried to interfere with him, and forced his way past the checkpoint.

When he was told to dismount to cross a newly built bridge, he became enraged and cut down (you can see where this is going). There are…a LOT of stories like that about him. By the by, it was, in fact, Lord Nobunaga who ordered these checkpoints to ask everyone to dismount and state their family name. For some reason, Mori’s behavior was forgiven.

According to Nobunaga:

“Can’t be helped because it’s Oni Musashi.”
