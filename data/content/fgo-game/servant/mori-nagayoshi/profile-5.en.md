Man Without Bones.
A Noble Phantasm named for the spear that was said to be able to cut through a human as though they didn’t have any bones. As the name suggests, it completely nullifies the target’s DEF. This Noble Phantasm doesn’t consume much magical energy. For all its simplicity, it is extremely powerful. In its normal form, it is a straight-bladed spear, while it becomes a cross-shaped spear when unleashed, with its ATK being powerfully enhanced.

『Hyakudan』

One Hundred Steps.
A Riding Noble Phantasm that would be used when Mori is summoned as a Lancer or Rider. It is named for Nagayoshi’s favorite horse. The horse was said to be able to gallop up the hundred stone steps of Kanayama Castle (Mori’s own castle) in but a single breath.

This is not used when summoned as Berserker class.
