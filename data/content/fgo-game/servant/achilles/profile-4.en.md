Comet Running Style.
Normally, this would be a Noble Phantasm.
A Noble Phantasm that is active as soon as he dismounts his Troias Tragōidia. This is the actualization of the legend that Achilles was the swiftest runner among all the heroes, in all of time. He can sprint across a vast battlefield in the space of a breath, and no obstacle can slow him. He must expose his heel, his sole weakness, in order to run, but only a handful of Heroic Spirits can catch him, as fast as he is.

The Amaranth of the Brave.
Normally, this would be a Noble Phantasm.
A blessing of immortality, save for his heel, bestowed upon him by his mother Thetis.
Nullifies all attacks. However, those with the Divinity skill may negate this effect.

The Spearhead Traveling through the Skies.
Normally, this would be a Noble Phantasm.
This can be activated by dismounting the Troias Tragōidia.
A spear that Chiron gave to Achilles’s parents when they married.
With his opponent’s consent, this powerful magecraft creates a realm similar to a Reality Marble expressly for a duel between the two heroes.
However, as he was not summoned as a Lancer, a portion of his abilities, such as inflicting incurable curses, are not available.
