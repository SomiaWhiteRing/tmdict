### Bond 3

Achilles was the son of the goddess Thetis and the hero Peleus. It was said that his fate was determined even in his youth. Knowing this, his mother, Thetis, tried to make him as close to the gods as possible by granting him immortality. To do this, she immolated Achillesâ€™s body in sacred flames in an attempt to burn away his impure human blood. In another version of this story, Thetis is said to have dipped Achilles in the river Styx.

To do this, though, would strip Achilles of his humanity entirely, so Peleus forbade Achilles from becoming completely immortal.

Thetis returned to her home, and Peleus, after careful consideration, entrusted Achilles to the sage Chiron for training. As Chiron was a good friend of Peleus, he was willing to take the boy on, and so Achilles began his training as a hero under the famed mentor, Chiron.

A few years later, Achilles grew to be a proud young man. He eagerly joined in the Trojan war when recruited by the Achaeans.

Obviously, Achilles had no idea about the tragedy awaiting him in Troy. But, even had he known what was in store for him, he would likely not have done anything differently.
