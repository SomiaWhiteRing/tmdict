The Trojan War started because Hektor’s younger brother Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband, Menelaus. Many heroes and kings fought over Helen and they all vowed to come to her aid if she was ever abducted.
This had little to do with Achilles, who was very young when the vow was made. However, when it was prophesied that the war could not be won without Peleus’s son, the Achaean forces were quick to recruit Achilles.
