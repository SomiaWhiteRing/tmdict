### Bond 2

An idealistic king who believes a good living and a good life is all anyone needs.
Protects the weak, punishes the strong, and is an all around a completely faultless person.
Calm and steady, she is always serious and a model human being.
…But, even though she doesn’t say it out loud, she hates losing.
She doesn’t go easy on herself, and feels great remorse when she loses.
