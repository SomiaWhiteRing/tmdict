### Bond 4

#### Primordial Rune (Warrior): B

He possesses Northern European magical crests called runes.
His abilities, which Brynhild taught him, are such that he may be summoned as a Caster.

#### Dragon Modification: EX

The ultimate form of Self-Modification, made possible after swallowing a dragon’s heart. A draconic magical energy reactor core was formed, so he is able to act almost independently even as a Servant.

#### Crystallized Wisdom: A

This crystallization of wisdom, taking the form of a magical tool that did not exist in the time period during which he lived, was obtained after he ate a dragon’s heart. He prefers to wear these glasses even though he never needed them while he lived, although it is certainly problematic when he decides to bathe.
While they work even when others wear them, they cause extreme headaches due to the vast amount of information they pour into the wearer’s mind.
