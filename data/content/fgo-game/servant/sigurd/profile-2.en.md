### Bond 2

A completely square, straitlaced man. The glasses he wears now did not exist during his lifetime. According to him, the glasses are the crystallization of wisdom itself. He says he obtained them after devouring the heart of a dragon.
At his core he is a rational person, and avenged his fatherâ€™s death not out of love, but rather a simple sense of duty.
His interactions with others come across as blunt and he seldom shows any kind of affection.
Should he ever come to protect someone without worrying about his own safety, that is when he has complete trust in said individual.
