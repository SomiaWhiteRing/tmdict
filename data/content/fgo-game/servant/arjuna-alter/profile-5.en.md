The Sword of Recursion That Arbitrates the Great Dissolution.
Arjuna’s other power bestowed to him along with his “Anti-Evil” skill, which is the sword of recursion that arbitrates dissolution. When everything is set to meet its end, he is tasked to swing his sword to eradicate evil and the world. Once he swings the sword, the whole of the world is completely destroyed. Mahāpralaya pertains to the moment Brahma dies and the universe comes to dissolution…in other words, it indicates saṃvartakalpa.

Though, even the peerless Arjuna is unable to wield the sword’s full power once he is summoned as a Servant. But the fact that its destructive powers are simply condensed and limited makes it no different than “Pashupata,” and it seems Arjuna thinks it’s still quite usable.
