### Clear Main Quest 「A World Where the Cycle ■■s」

He reigned as a perfect god in the Indian Lostbelt. His original personality was overwritten, and he was a literal Deus Ex Machina…where he became a figurative concept that continuously helped cycle the world.

However, Arjuna’s egotism (even if it was only to the extent of wanting to best someone, the desire to be great, and to hate and be angry at something) that controlled his personality and continued to endure was what, ironically, enabled him to regain his humanity. His incessant desire to beat Karna was what brought him back to humanity.

In the Indian Lostbelt, taking in various Authorities of gods made him go berserk, and he was unforgiving to even the slightest failures. But now that he has been summoned as a Servant, the only thing he doesn’t tolerate is evil that challenge his Master, and he even shows a glimpse of kindness typically found in the Arjuna from Proper Human History.
