### Bond 4

Typically he conducts himself as a perfect device of destruction that has shed its human qualities. This was the price he had to pay in order to change from one who brings about end to gain Anti-Evil skills and Divinity as his Authority.

Archer Arjuna carries himself by holding an ideal image of what a hero should be, while the Lostbelt Servant Arjuna (Alter) idolizes Archer Arjuna as a proud hero.
