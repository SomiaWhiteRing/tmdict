“Bound as I am, these mourning robes are dyed but a shallow shade of gray,
Yet there are depths where the tears have made pools on my sleeves.”

When this poem is read with its True Name revealed, it works as a curse and hurls destruction upon its victims, inflicting both damage and debuffs.

This is a waka poem from chapter nine of “The Tale of Genji” and is titled “Aoi.” It is a lamentation Hikaru Genji reads when his wife passes away shortly after giving birth to their son, Yuugiri. The cause of Aoi-no-Ue’s death was a powerful grudge from Lady Rokujyo, Genji’s mistress. This functions as a type of death curse. By reading the lamentation touching on grudges and death curses, the Caster Murasaki Shikibu mourns the fate of her targets.

It is worth noting that the anecdotes revolving around the death of Aoi-no-Ue reference the Noh play of the same name.
