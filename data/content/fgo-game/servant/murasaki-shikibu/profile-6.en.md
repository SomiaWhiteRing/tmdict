### Bond 5

Physical publications, paper books… She is a librarian in a vast library that is home to many, many books.

Specifically, her curse magecraft converts all electronic publications into paper books, quietly building a library through her collection. As the sole administrator, librarian, and master, she protects this cool, dark haven for books. If asked, she is pleased to give advice on how to write diaries and letters.

She’s also able to find the book best suited for a person simply by looking at them. The book’s themes will always be to a person’s interests, like love or revenge stories, since she is a Heroic Spirit so closely tied to sentiment.

“I am a Heroic Spirit who creates compositions to suit people’s feelings. What I put down on paper always focuses on how people feel about each other.”
