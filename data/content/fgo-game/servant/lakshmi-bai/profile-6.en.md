### Clear Main Quest 「A World Where the Cycle ■■s」

Even though she’s a modern Servant, her ties with the Indian Lostbelt have enabled her to possess Divinity.
Because of these special circumstances, the Divided Spirit of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi dwells in her body, establishing a situation where she is almost like a Pseudo-Servant. The fact that their names are the same also heightened their affinity on a magecraft level to push the situation even further.
…Though that’s not exactly accurate. The goddess she harbors within herself is actually Lakshmi’s older sister, the goddess of misfortune and ill fate, Alakshmi. (There is also a theory that they are the same person, or she is a different aspect of Lakshmi.) Some also say that Alakshmi is the second wife of the demon Kali, who appears during the Kali Yuga period.

But really, only a portion of this goddess dwells within, and so her personality remains mostly that of Rani Lakshmi. And so the goddess elements that Lakshmi Bai possesses are as follows:
Divinity, which works like fuel to drive her.
Alakshmi’s impulses that sometimes bubble up from within.
Being a goddess of ill fate, some lingering elements of failure cause her to be…a huge klutz.
