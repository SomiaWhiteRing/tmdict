### Bond 2

After her husband, the king, died from illness, Lakshmi was tasked with negotiating the fate of the Jhansi kingdom with Britain.
In this period, Britain established a policy called the doctrine of lapse, where adopted individuals were not recognized to claim the throne, and any nation that did not have an heir was annexed by the East India Company. In consequence, Lakshmi’s hopes to continue the kingdom through adoption were shattered.
When the Indian Governor-General Dalhousie’s envoy declared that Jhansi was going to be annexed as British territory, Lakshmi did not shed a tear, but instead firmly declared, “I shall not surrender my Jhansi!”
