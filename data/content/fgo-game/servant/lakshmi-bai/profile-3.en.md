### Bond 3

Later, Lakshmi became the symbol of resistance for the people of Jhansi. The Jhansi rebel force, many of whom were female soldiers inspired by Lakshmi, fought with daring and determination, so much that the British were astonished by their bravery.
In 1858, Jhansi palace was taken over by suppression forces, but Lakshmi managed to escape. She joined with other rebel forces and continued her resistance movement from the city of Gwalior.
However, the resistance never gained further momentum, and two months later, the British army successfully executed an all-out attack on the city.
While Lakshmi fought valiantly in this battle, it was said that she sustained a bullet wound while commanding the front lines and died.
