The Kingdom That Rejects Usurpation.
This Noble Phantasm is the actualization of Lakshmi’s strong resolve and wish to protect her country at all cost.

Typically this would be a Bounded Field Noble Phantasm that generates a territory that protects those inside from outside invaders. As she protected the Jhansi kingdom with her life, this Noble Phantasm is activated by a causal relationship such that what she protects becomes her kingdom.
As she was summoned as a Saber this time around, this Noble Phantasm hinges on the concept that she is “rejecting outside enemies” and converts it into an attack, functioning as an Anti-Army attack.
Her sword’s gleam carries all her thoughts and prayers, and it represents her resolve that carries the fate of her country. Thus, it is a blade that will never bend or break, and it mows down the enemy by leveraging the radiance and weight of a country’s future.
