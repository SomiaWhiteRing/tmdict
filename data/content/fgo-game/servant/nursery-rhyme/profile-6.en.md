### Clear Interlude 「A Bunch of Books, a Crowd of Us」

Nursery Rhyme is not a hero, but a general term for a genre of picture books.
This genre has long been loved in England, and after being the home for so many children’s dreams, began to exist as a “concept,” which became a Servant that is “the hero of children.”
They would later form the foundation for the work of famous author Lewis Carroll.
