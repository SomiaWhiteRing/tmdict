### Clear Main Quest 「Terza Cantica: Paraíso (Ending)」

#### Curse of the Orochi: B

A superpower that has been passed down for generations.
It is a curse of a great deity that has a deep connection with the ancestor of the Mochizuki clan of Kouga. While it torments the possessor’s physical body as well as their mind, control of the curse will turn it into an invisible weapon.
One member from each generation of the Kouga Mochizuki clan possesses this power.
