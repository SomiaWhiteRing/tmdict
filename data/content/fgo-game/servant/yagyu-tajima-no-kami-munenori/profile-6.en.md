### Clear Main Quest 「See You Again Someday, Flower at the Apex of Heaven」

During his lifetime, it is said that Munenori criticized Musashi’s way of life. Munenori commented that “Musashi is from the Western Army,” and he is “an enemy of Tokugawa.”
Though Munenori would never have crossed paths with or battled Musashi in his lifetime, Musashi was on his mind…

As a Heroic Spirit summoned in Chaldea, Munenori acknowledges Musashi’s skill. However, his opinion on the Miyamoto Musashi from his own world…is still unclear.
