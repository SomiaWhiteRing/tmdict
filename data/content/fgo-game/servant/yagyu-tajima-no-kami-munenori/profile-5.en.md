Peerless Swordsmanship, The Sword and Zen Are One.
Be both free and possess an unwavering mind.
The secrets of swordsmanship once spoken by the Buddhist priest Takuan were finally realized by Yagyu Munenori.
A sword shows its true worth on the boundary of life and death, while zen allows one to reach enlightenment through reflective meditation.
Kenzen Ichinyo, the blade swung by one void of worldly thoughts, brings certain death with a single blow.
