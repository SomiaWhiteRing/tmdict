### Bond 4

#### Heaven-Sent Child of Kurama: A+

A blessing from something that dwells in the mountains of Kurama.
Ushiwakamaru appears to think that it’s a blessing from the tengu of the sacred mountain, but the details are a bit fuzzy.

Madame H: “The etymology of ‘Kurama’ comes from the word for ‘dark mountains,’ and its old name is ‘Kurabuyama.’ But if you think about it, maybe this place used to actually be called ‘Kumara.’ What do you think!?”
