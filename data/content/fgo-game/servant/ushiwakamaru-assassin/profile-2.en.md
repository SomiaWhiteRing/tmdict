### Bond 2

After being surrounded by Hawaii’s natural beauty (and putting on her swimsuit), Ushiwakamaru somehow reverted to how she was during her wild and free-spirited days training at Mt. Kurama.

Her master’s words echo in her mind. “Play is the ultimate form of training.” And so while she fulfills her duty as a Servant, she is ever alert for a chance to play (train) with Master. Like a faithful, playful dog in summer, she wags her tail in anticipation (though somehow remains patient) for playtime. If you have some spare time, go ahead and play with her.
