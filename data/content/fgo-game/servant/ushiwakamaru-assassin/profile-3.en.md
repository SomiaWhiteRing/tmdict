### Bond 3

#### Animal Communication: D

Communicating with animals is possible.
This is a skill that was obtained during her youth in the mountains, and when she left the mountains (when she became a Rider), she lost this ability. She doesn’t really speak animal languages, but instead communicates through feelings and instinct.
Sometimes tanuki language slips out as well, which can be a holdover from her old training days.

If you ask her why she is an Assassin now, her answer would be:

“I wanted to pull a surprise attack on my master while he was sleeping, so I practiced by concealing my presence from the forest animals. Yep.”

“Seriously, that’s all it took to become an Assassin!?”

“Well, yeah. I am a genius.”
