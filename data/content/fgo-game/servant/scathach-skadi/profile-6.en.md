### Clear Main Quest 「Go, Beyond the Twilight」

A queen to be feared.
The goddess of snow and ice.

However…
Though she was able to hide this fact while ruling the Lostbelt, she regrets that she was one of those left behind. She was beloved and even courted by the gods, but then Ragnarök came, and the gods disappeared leaving her alone in the Scandinavian Lostbelt. The last god.
On top of that…

She’s actually pretty thoughtless.
She’s actually pretty ditzy.
She’s actually warmhearted.
If you develop a relationship with her, she may reveal a side of herself other than the queen… She may even reveal her true self, one neither god nor ruler…just the natural self beneath it all without needing to keep up the appearance of being the mother of Scandinavia.
