### Bond 2

Oui dreamt of becoming a fairy-tale character more than an ukiyo-e artist during her youth, and this is what that girl is like all grown up.
This Oui has yet to experience the obstacles of artistry and the frustrations of divorce, and she has a heady confidence in her own artistic talents that would one day surpass her own Father, Hokusai.

With her heart set on surpassing her father, she takes the name “Katsushika Hokusai” without permission, even though she is still a greenhorn. Even so, there’s something about her that the adult Oui lacks.
