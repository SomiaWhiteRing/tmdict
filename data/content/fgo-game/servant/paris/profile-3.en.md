### Bond 3

Paris grew into a handsome man with outstanding intelligence, and one day he was tasked to judge who was the most beautiful among the goddesses Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera.
If chosen, Hera offered kingship and wealth, Athena offered victory and beauty, and Aphrodite promised the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman of Greece. Paris chose Aphrodite as the most beautiful.

However, Helen was already married to King Menelaus, so Paris ultimately ended up absconding with someone else’s wife.

The men who once pursued Helen’s hand in marriage had all vowed to work together to defend Helen’s marriage in the event of her abduction.
Battle then became inevitable, and in the end, Troy would go into war against the Greek allied forces. This would eventually become the Trojan War.
