### Bond 4

#### Independent Action: EX

While Paris himself has no access to Independent Action, Apollo, who acts like a guardian spirit, does as he will.

#### Grace of the God: B

Receives the absolute affection from Apollo. It’s a bit of a pain, but Paris somewhat enjoys it.
It’s a skill very much like Grace of the Goddess. The extent of the curses is also similar.
