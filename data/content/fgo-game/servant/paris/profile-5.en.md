The Dazzling Single Arrow To End the Heavens.
The mighty single shot using the Sun God Apollo’s powers.
It can overcome any obstacle and will always hit the enemy’s weak point.
This Noble Phantasm is the famous weak point-striking hero killer. It’s not only effective against Achilles, but as long as his weakness is exposed, it can even defeat Siegfried, who is strengthened by dragon’s blood. However, in conjunction with knowing the enemy’s weakness, the target’s AGL, LUK, and MP rank also have influence.

Golden Apple of Discord. The Apple of Misfortune.
An apple harboring divine power that brings about discord.
The apple that was supposed to be awarded to the most beautiful goddess ultimately brought about the Trojan War.
The apple itself does not have any destructive power, yet it’s an extremely troubling item that brings enormous destruction to both enemies and allies.
To defend against it, LUK and mental resistance are key.
This is not used in FGO.
