### Bond 3

#### Dream Upon the Star: D

A hope and end that all fleeting lives reach for and take hold of.
This Leonardo da Vinci has lost the skill Pioneer of the Stars, but in exchange, the knowledge of an intelligent being’s purpose, as well as the truth all short-lived beings seek, dwells within her soul as her art.
(This young Da Vinci was created by the original Da Vinci, the greatest among all human thinkers, and inherited that intellect. Ultimately, the girl Da Vinci comes to understand that short-lived, man-made beings, like Mash and other homunculi, have their own philosophies and ways of living.)

Please place your final dream upon this dying star…
A dream made at the end of their infancy, a small yet glittering dream…
