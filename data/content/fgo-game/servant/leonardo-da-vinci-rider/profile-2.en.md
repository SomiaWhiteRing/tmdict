### Bond 2

#### Golden Rule (Body): EX

Her universal nature may have narrowed due to her new compact form, but in exchange, her Golden Rule skill has gone up.
It was pointless to ask about her gender from the get-go, but as her body is a girl-type, it carries even more of a religious “angelic” form and meaning.

#### Accel Turn: B

A skill inspired by summer Ishtar.
As a skilled driver, she is able to make emergency maneuvers in times of need.

#### Overhaul: E

Scatters nanomachines created using pseudo-spiritrons and “resets” the statuses of everyone in the party.
If the skill is at its maximum rank, it not only resets destroyed armor and damaged Spirit Origins, but it also returns the NP Gauge back to its default state at the beginning of battle. However, the Da Vinci within the vessel of a small girl cannot achieve this potential.
