### Bond 2

She managed to unify the nation of Echigo, which was plagued with constant civil war. She would dispatch troops multiple times after receiving aid from other nations to lead innumerable battles between the Takeda and Hojo clan.
She led from the front lines, and her overwhelming charisma and tactical talents made her an excellent commander. Even after seventy-plus battles during her lifetime, she did not suffer a single defeat in a major campaign.

She changed her name multiple times during her lifetime, going by Nagao Kagetora, Uesugi Masatora, and ultimately Uesugi Terutora. Her most famous name, “Kenshin,” was her Buddhist name after she dedicated herself to Buddhism.

“Eh? The Kenshin name’s more famous than Kagetora!?”
