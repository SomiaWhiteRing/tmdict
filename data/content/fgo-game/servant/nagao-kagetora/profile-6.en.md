### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: GUDAGUDA Pipe Dream」

As a self-proclaimed avatar of Bishamonten, Kagetora tasked herself with protecting the people, deeming it the righteous course. Yet, because she had always been strong, she never truly comprehended what human frailty was.

Kagetora did not understand human emotions like sadness, anger, and so many other subtleties of human feeling. The only thing she could do to get along with people was smile. Even so, her detached words and behavior toward her retainers soon led them to fear her, which ultimately evolved and became fanatical faith. This is how Kagetora was forced to live a life beyond humanity, as an almost godlike being. In consequence, conflicts on the battlefield where life and death come face-to-face were the only time she felt human at all.

Her detached life was what enabled her to gain her place in the Throne as a god of war. Whether that was her true intention…nobody will never know.

―Bishamonten is here.
