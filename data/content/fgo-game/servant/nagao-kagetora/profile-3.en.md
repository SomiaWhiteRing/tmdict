### Bond 3

Kagetora was constantly troubled. Which weapon would be the strongest on the battlefield: A sword or a spear? Firearms? They miss, so those are no good.

And then one day, Kagetora encountered the eight-bladed Bishamonten, a statue depicting an inhuman form of the god Bishamonten wielding eight swords, and she came to a realization. That’s right! You just need a sword AND spear!

The next day, she brandished eight weapons, calling her style Hakka no Sonae, the Flourishing Eight Defenses, and the War God of Echigo was then seen tearing her way through the battlefield.

Thus, the great, invincible general of the warring states, “Full Armored Kagetora,” was born.
