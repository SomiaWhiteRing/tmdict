The Greiving Song of the Departed Soul’s Cursed Blood.
A savage move that releases over-the-limit magical energy to go on a rampage, destroying her own physical body and inducing calamatmous weather by chanting a curse. Her body is reassembled afterwards. It’s a self-destruct attack made possible by an Elemental type like her who shares a spiritual core with the environment.
