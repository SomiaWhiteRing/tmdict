### Clear Main Quest 「The Crimson Beauty under the Moon」 and Bond 4

#### Incarnated Elemental: A

As an Elemental who shares mana with nature, she doesn’t store magical energy inside her body, but rather she draws limitless energy from external sources. However, as she is bound by a humanoid form, there is a limit in how much output she can generate despite her infinite supply, and the amount of magical energy that she can make use is limited within the range of a humanoid Heroic Spirit.

#### Taoist Winged Sage: A

Describes an immortal sage as told in Taoist philosophies. As intervention from nature is needed to maintain her physical body, which ultimately may have forced her to be bound in a humanoid form.

#### Vampirism: C

Certain amounts of energy can be pilfered from various living creatures for gain. While technically not blood-feeding, the ability was perceived as vampirism, and so she was persecuted by various agents throughout history.
