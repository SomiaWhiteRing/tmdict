### Clear Main Quest 「The Crimson Beauty under the Moon」 and Bond 3

An incarnated Elemental, as well as a bloodsucker who takes in nourishment through draining energy. She is neither a Demonic Beast nor a Phantasmal, and she was born from the earth’s inner sea as a terminal for surface-level maintenance. In the world of mages, she falls under a category parallel to a True Ancestor, and while her development is close to that, she is a bloodsucking species with a different objective as a life-form.

She is, as ancient Chinese folklore would call her, a fairy or Zhenren, and as her intellect and self-consciousness were obtained later on, she herself is not clear on her origin story.
