Venusian God, Silver Ring.
A neo-Noble Phantasm that Helena brought with her upon her class change.
A silver-colored circle. It’s made out of the same material as her Noble Phantasm’s UFO in her Caster form. It’s said to be composed of elements not found anywhere on this world.
When its True Name is revealed, multiple flying objects appear, and rain a barrage of light beams. Violent explosions ensue, but none ever seem to hit Helena.
