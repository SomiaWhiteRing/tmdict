The She-Wolf’s Fury.
Gareth’s brilliance in jousting sublimated into a Noble Phantasm.
After a rapid succession of vigorous strikes, a final, fatal blow pierces the enemy.
When Gareth fought a battle to protect her best friend Lady Lyonesse, it was said that she defeated notable knights with a single lance, including Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Galihodin, Sir Galehaut (not to be mistaken with Galahad), Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Tayle, Sir Sagramore le Desirious, Sir Dodinas le Savage, King Anguish of Ireland, King Carados of Scotland, King Uriens, and King Bagdemagus of Gore.

In another time and place, Gareth challenged King Arthur in a jousting match, and she was praised for her fighting and dubbed the “Raging Wolf”.
