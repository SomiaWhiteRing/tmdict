### Bond 2

Gareth was the last member to join the Round Table, and she is the least experienced among all the knights.
She revered all her senior knights of the Round Table. She was especially attached to Sir Lancelot and often followed him around.
She went through rigorous training during her squire days, and like Gaheris, she didn’t accompany her older brother Gawain, but instead chose to act as an attendant to Lancelot.

Gareth was loved by many, due to her boundless potential, and even the other Round Table knights beyond her brothers all thought highly of her, saying,
“She will be a great knight one day.”
“She’s sure to be a true knight, on par with her brothers.”
