Penthesilea is an Amazonian queen of Greek mythology. She is the daughter of Ares, and is said to have multiple sisters, including Hippolyta, whose girdle was stolen by Heracles.

After the death of Hektor, the Amazon military led by Penthesilea sided with Troy, and fought against the Achaean forces.
And thus Queen Penthesilea engaged in a duel with the enemy’s hero, Achilles. Its conclusion resulted in the greatest humiliation of Penthesilea’s life.
