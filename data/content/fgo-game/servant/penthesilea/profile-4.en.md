#### Madness Enhancement: EX

It is generally possible to communicate with her.
However, whenever she is confronted by Achilles, her sense of reason evaporates. She has a similar, if not as powerful, response to seeing any of the loathed Greek heroes.
Calling her beautiful may also elicit a similar response.

#### Roar of the God of War: A+

The roar that calls up the blood of Ares that courses through her veins.
Warriors that fight by her side are emboldened and strengthened by the roar, as if led by the God of War himself.
During the Trojan War, it was said that the battle cry of the Amazons caused the enemy to tremble in fear.

Whenever she comes face-to-face with the cause of her rage (a Greek hero, or anything similar derived from the Greeks) her roar will sound until she, or her enemy, is killed.
