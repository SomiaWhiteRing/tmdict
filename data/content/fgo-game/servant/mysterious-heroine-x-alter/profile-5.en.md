### Bond 5

The last successor of the now-annihilated dark chivalric order, the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S.
Her given title is Lord Pendragon.

She has various special moves, such as her telekinetic “Alter Choke” and the “Alter Lightning” she shoots from her fingers. Both look a little familiar.
Her Evil Sacred Sword Necro-calibur, which emits red magical energy, can freely change its form. Twin blades or even a chainsaw form are possible, but it often breaks and explodes.
“The cooler a weapon looks, the weaker it is,” seems to be the common understanding across all the universe.
Ultimately, a regular longsword is a safer bet.
