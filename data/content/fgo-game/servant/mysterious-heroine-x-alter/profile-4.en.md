### Bond 4

An Alternium crystal embedded within her Mana Conversion Altereactor Engine converts calories into magical energy.
“Japanese Wasanbon sugar’s elemental balance has the best conversion rate. Oh, and I want green tea,” she emphasizes.
Her glasses are a necessity, to rest her boosted optic nerves. When she wears them, her vision actually gets worse.

She possesses a mysterious item called “∞ (Infinity) Black Bean Paste.” It is made from the six atomic energies: desire (soul), sugar (power), store (space), SRP (reality), production (time), and demand (mind). It is said to grant its owner infinite power, but X Alter doesn’t really get it.
