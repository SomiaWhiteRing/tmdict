### Bond 2

Semiramis was born to the goddess Derketo and an unknown human. She was abandoned at the waterside by an embarrassed Derketo. However, as Semiramis was a descendant of the gods, she survived, and was raised by a flock of doves.

Semiramis grew to become a beautiful maiden, and she married an aging general named Onnes. However, King Ninus, an ambitious leader, was quite taken with Semiramis’s beauty, and ultimately tore the couple apart. The separation greatly saddened Onnes, who killed himself. Semiramis had no choice but to accept King Ninus’s affection.
When war broke out, Semiramis’s unorthodox tactical advice led her nation to victory. This led to King Ninus recognizing her talent, which prompted him to ask for her hand in marriage.
However, on the day of the wedding banquet, King Ninus collapsed, writhing in agony, and died. The citizens whispered that Semiramis had poisoned the king to avenge her late husband.
And so Semiramis became the Empress of Assyria, and commanded numerous expeditions and construction projects as regent for decades.

Some legends say that she was murdered by her own son, while other legends say that after she ceded her power, she turned into a dove and flew away.
