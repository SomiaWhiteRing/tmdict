Hanging Gardens of Vanity.
In actuality, Semiramis had nothing to do with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. However, by tapping into the many deeply rooted misconceptions in the popular belief surrounding them, she was able to secure them as her own Noble Phantasm.

As these Hanging Gardens are an object of empty vanity, the conditions for deploying them are strict.
A specific amount of stones and soil taken from a specific ruin from a very specific time in a specific place in the Middle East must be gathered. Only after this is done, and a three-day ritual is conducted, will this Noble Phantasm be ready to function.

As its name suggests, it manifests as a giant floating fortress.
As long as she is within this fortress, all of Semiramis’s stats increase dramatically. Her notoriety also increases to its highest possible level, and she gains a number of modifications that make her attacks much more advantageous to her as well.

During a certain Holy Grail war, this garden was the site of a decisive battle. Its eleven defensive spells shot down a fleet of airplanes, but those defenses were ultimately breached by a holy maiden’s banner and a flying knight’s attack.
