### Bond 5

She is a cunning and ambitious empress who would tread upon anyone, friend or foe, using poison to psychologically break them or simply to kill them.
Highly suspicious of others, she will dispose of her own allies, even when such an action would be unnecessary. This also means that she has absolute confidence in her own powers (when within her own territory, at least).
Because of this, she is absolutely incompatible with other kings, nor does she ever make the first move.
Should there ever be a time when the Hanging Gardens of Babylon reach their final form, she will possess unparalleled power within them, and so will become far more aggressive in her actions.
