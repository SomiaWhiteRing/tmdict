#### 『Arondight Overload』

By overloading Arondight, it causes the sword to overflow with magical energy, and then reroutes the energy for attacks.
A type of sword skill that purposely stores the magical energy that would have been used as a projectile and releases it all at once when the sword slashes into the enemy.
It is said the blue light of the massive amount of energy released looks like the light that reflects off the surface of a lake.
