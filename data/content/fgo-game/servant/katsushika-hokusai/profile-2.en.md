### Bond 2

An ukiyo-e painter and printmaker during the late Edo Period.
In addition to working under the name “Katsushika Hokusai,” he produced artwork under thirty different pen names, including “Gakyou Roujin” (“painting-obsessed old man”) and “Souri.”
One of Japan’s most prominent artists, his works were also a great influence on many painters and musicians like Vincent van Gogh and Claude Debussy.
Known to be a rapid painter, Hokusai created over 30,000 pieces of art in his life, including ukiyo-e prints, paintings, sketches, and shunga erotic artwork.
In his later years, he lived with his daughter and assistant Katsushika Oui.
Some of his representative works are “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji”, “Hokusai Manga”, “One Hundred Ghost Tales”, and “The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife”.
He moved 93 times during his lifetime, was careless with money, and is considered to have been very…eccentric.
It was said that whenever he went out, he could be heard mumbling a mysterious chant…
