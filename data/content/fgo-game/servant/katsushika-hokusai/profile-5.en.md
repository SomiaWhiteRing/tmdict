### Bond 5

Hokusai had a peculiar personality.
He didn’t limit himself to a single drawing style, instead proactively studying other schools’ techniques. However, he never allowed traditions to tie him down, instead always keeping his thoughts on the future.
For example, he learned the techniques of perspective drawing from Western art. He also blended snapshots of sudden movement with landscape painting, a technique that can be said to be the starting point of modern manga expression.
Should he manifest in modern times, free of the shogunate’s harsh restrictions, he would gladly spend every waking moment challenging himself to reach new artistic heights, whether through the medium of shunga, abstract art, digital art, or even performance art.
