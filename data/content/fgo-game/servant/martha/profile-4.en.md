### Bond 4

A perfect saint inside and out. She is like a little sister, though most of the time she acts like the complete opposite.
Kind and just, she is someone who glimmers with radiance of the light.
However… to someone she grew especially close to, she might show the side of her that’s “Not Saint Martha.”
