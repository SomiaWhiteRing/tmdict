### Bond 5

When Martha is “not a saint,” her choice of words and expressions become more fierce.
She’s more energetic and active. This is her before she was a saint, when she was just a town girl living with her brother and sister.
Though she’s still the same person in her expressions and choice of words.
She’s still a saint no matter what, the only difference is she is more filtered one way than the other.
