### Bond 3

A Pseudo-Servant.
The jaguar nagual manifests into this world as a Divided Spirit by using specific humans as a vessel. In ancient times, it was said that anyone who gained a jaguar nagual would possess supernatural powers. Stories of nagual are still told in modern times.

As a side note, the vessel selection criteria involves finding those who have a relationship to the Grail, and among them, whomever has the most feral calling.
