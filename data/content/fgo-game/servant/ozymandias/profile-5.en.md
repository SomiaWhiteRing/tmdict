The Shining Great Temple Complex.
A Noble Phantasm that is the manifestation of Pharaoh Ozymandias’ glory. Summons a massive, twisted complex of temples and tombs that forms a type of Reality Marble.
The primary method of attack of this Noble Phantasm is magical bombardment using the Great Lightbulb Dendera, but in this work, its last resort of large-mass attack is performed.
