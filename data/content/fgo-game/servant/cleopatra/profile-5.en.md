### Bond 5

She died after falling in love with two men.
She was in love. Her feelings were true. She wasn’t plotting anything… But not only in later years, but in her own times, it was said that she was a temptress who had bewitched the generals of Rome. As a result, after becoming a Heroic Spirit and being summoned as a Servant, she became “a bewitching temptress possessed of incredible beauty.”

Even so, as a matter of pride, she only allows herself to fall for the most splendid of gentlemen.
She is a loyal woman who is willing to die with the man she loves, and will only tempt those who are a match for the men she once loved.
