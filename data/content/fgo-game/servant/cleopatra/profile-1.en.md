Strictly speaking, the last Pharaoh was her child Caesarion, whom she chose as joint ruler during the last years of her life. This is because Caesarion lived at least a few days after her death. However, when Caesarion died, he was only 9 years old. In reality, the last Pharaoh who ruled over Egypt and struggled against fate was Cleopatra.
