### Bond 3

She behaves as a queen, but at her core she is very polite, always looking out for those around her and trying to keep the peace. When ambassadors from other countries arrived, she would first insult them, but at the same time, care for their health, saying:

“In my country, my words are the law.
Anyone who’s ugly, no matter who they are, is no different from a slave!
Hmph! Prepare yourselves, you inferior and baseborn scum!
You may begin to serve me by resting and relaxing right here!”

This was the best form of hospitality she could offer them.
For this reason, it’s said there was no end of ambassadors requesting audiences with her in order to be insulted.
