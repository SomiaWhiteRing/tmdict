### Bond 2

Serving the High King of Erin, he was a man who attained appropriate achievements to be admired as both the leader and the greatest knight of the glorious Knights of Fianna.
He defeated the fallen Divine Spirit Aillen, a demonic boar, a horse from the underworld and finally Nuadha, the God of War himself.
It has been said that he was a great man who in times of peace would go on hunting trips with his subordinates in the knight order.
