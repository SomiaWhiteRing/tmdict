### Bond 5

The Noble Phantasmâ€™s original purpose is the amplification, assistance, and strengthening of magecraft, but the magical energy of the blade allows for instant execution of ritual spells.
By using the five elements as a catalyst, it is possible to create a pseudo-composition of the True Ether that is said to only exist in the Age of Gods.
The power of the True Ether (fake) is immense and capable of destroying an entire area in an instant.
