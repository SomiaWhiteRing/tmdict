### Bond 3

After becoming Carmilla, she does not get along with Elisabeth at all, and their relationship is one where they try to kill each other.
This is because young Elisabeth refuses to become Carmilla, and Elisabeth is the intolerable symbol that covets innocence and glorifies adolescence, for Carmilla.
