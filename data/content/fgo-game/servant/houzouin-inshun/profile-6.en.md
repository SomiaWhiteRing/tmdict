### Clear 「A Fight Against the Self (Literally)」

Inshun never wanted to kill, nor fight. He was a Buddhist monk, and so neither rank nor status held any allure for him. Instead, his interest in his spear lay simply in honing his skill.
There are humans who surpass beasts.
There are humans who surpass oni.
There are humans who surpass man.
The only thing that could challenge such people is pure skill. After all, it is said that even small pebbles can become a castle wall if they are stacked up little by little.

Inshun believes this is the way of man. There is no specific record of Inshun ever actually fighting anyone, but his skill and technique were praised as having “surpassed gods and the Buddha.”
