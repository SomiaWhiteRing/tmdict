### Bond 2

Houzouin Inshun. His secular name was Mitsuda Gennosuke. As the successor of the Houzouin name, he learned the ways of the spear and monk from In’ei, the founder of Houzouinryu Soujutsu.
At that time, Houzouin’s Soujutsu was already widely known because of In’ei’s exploits. It was he who had the revolutionary idea of modifying the original simple spear into a jumonji spear, a cross-shaped spear, so one could cut, sweep, and hammer in addition to standard thrusts.
