The Far Side of the Pale Moon.
Houzouin Inshun’s mastered technique using the jumonji spear serves as his Noble Phantasm. This NP uses Inshun’s Back Eleven Forms, in contrast to In’ei’s Front Fifteen Forms. It is molded after the skills of Inshun, whose spearmanship was said to be a match for gods and the Buddha, and can be adapted to defeat any enemy or attack.
In addition, should it be his first encounter with an enemy, no matter how peculiar or unknown their weapon may be, this Noble Phantasm will resolve any disadvantages that may arise from this unfamiliarity.
