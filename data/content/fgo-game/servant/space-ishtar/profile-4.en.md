### Bond 4

#### Avenger: EX

Even though she was once a great goddess, by some twist of fate she has come to be despised even by the devil. Though this leaves her a dizzying combination of sad, anguished, and enraged, even she is forced to admit that there was no excuse for her behavior. The fact that she admits her own evil, even though she stands on the side of justice and law, makes her something of a failed Avenger.
*This goddess was called “Ashtart” in the Old Testament, which was the generalized name for all foreign goddesses and goddesses of good harvest. Despite this name originating from the Old Testament, it was later demoted to become the origin for the word devil (Astaroth) in the West.

#### Devil’s Sugar: A

She is still a true devil who perfectly utilizes her charm and seductive powers, even though she is gloomy at having fallen to devilhood. Space Ishtar’s smile and air kiss increase her allies’ morale and boost their powers to the absolute limit, ignoring any physical limitations. It’s basically a Charm curse applied to her allies, and any Charm attacks from enemies are nullified because they’re already Charmed.
You can say that she is a charismatic devil who combines aspects of both the goddess of victory and the devil who leads humans to destruction.

#### Venus Driver: B

Someone who drives the planet Venus. Or someone who drives beauty.
With the protection of Venus, the Noble Phantasm’s strength increases, and it can also change its attributes at will. A skill equivalent to the primordial goddess, from which other goddesses are derived.

#### Multiple Starling: EX

The one and only great crown.
The various crowns of the various goddesses dubbed the “queen of the heavens,” derived from the original goddess Ishtar is based on, are stacked atop each other to come close to the original complete form.
