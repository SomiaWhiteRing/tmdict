### Bond 2

An outlaw, yet a heroine of justice.
She acts like the bad guy, yet everything she does is for the sake of others, which puts her in an interesting position.
She is aware that she is supposed to be a threat to humanity, and so her alignment is Evil, but it doesn’t mean that she is a villain or that she is wicked.
She has pretty much the same personality as Ishtar from Proper Human History, but she does not try to toy with others for her own entertainment.

She will proudly acknowledge anybody’s good deeds as being in the right while praising them in secret, and she will glare at anybody with hatred for doing bad deeds while deriding them in public.
(And if that person is a villain, she will not hesitate to squeeze out every last ounce of their fortune, lifeforce, and fate).

Like Ishtar, Space Ishtar has a free-spirited personality, and she looks down on human society’s cruel and thoughtless nature. Despite that, she takes the livelihoods of people into consideration while looking out for those with better natures, and she ultimately prioritizes everyone else’s welfare above her own personal rewards. She’s the polar opposite of Ishtar.

For example, during the Summer Race, Ishtar did not hesitate to sacrifice others to restore Gugalanna to regain her Authority. If the same situation happened with Space Ishtar, she would have reflected on her actions and then personally destroyed Gugalanna and divvyed up its resources amongst the participants.
“Well yeah, I would feel like kicking and screaming because it would be such a big waste, but I would feel that I had to do that! You know, I just can’t lie!”
As you can see, she is essentially Ishtar, but at the very last second she does the right thing…

In other words, Space Ishtar is the sort of goddess who would make the regular Ishtar look bad.
