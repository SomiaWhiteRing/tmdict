### Clear Main Quest 「Prologue」

A demon or oni from hell who operates the Enma-tei. She is the adopted daughter of Datsue-ba, the old woman who works on the banks of the Sanzu, and the Great King Enma. It is said that she was a little slave girl who died wandering in the mountains. By order of the Great King Enma, she was tasked with managing a magoiya, a house for lost souls that measures the sins of those who visit. At one point, however, she was struck by a surge of loneliness and descended the mountain to a human village, where a mean old woman terrorized her. A kind old man saved her, which prompted her to support virtuous humans, giving rise to the story of the tongue-cut sparrow as it is known today.

In addition, at the request of various Heroic Spirits, she holds regular cooking classes in the Throne of Heroes. She is a child chef as well as a tough-as-nails instructor. Uzume is among those who have graduated Beni-Enma’s cooking class. The female Japanese yokai-type Servants are all educated by Beni-Enma. No matter what legend or myth they have as their origin, Servants who did not know how to cook at all like Tamamo-no-Mae, Kiyohime, Osakabehime, Takiyashahime, and Suzuka Gozen all count Beni-Enma as their feared and respected teacher.
