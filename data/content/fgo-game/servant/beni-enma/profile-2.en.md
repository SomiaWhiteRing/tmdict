### Bond 2

She appears in folklore as a creature who helps humans in the mountains. This description is retained in the Uji Shui Monogatari, a collection of stories created during the early Kamakura period. Normally she wouldn’t be a summonable Heroic Spirit, but she became a Servant who represents those who accept the wishes of children.

She’s proactive, yet an introvert. While she may appear to be a cute little girl, she is truly a swordsman with the bearing of a government official. Both earnest and thoughtful, she is fearless in her interactions with others, though she is always respectful no matter who she addresses. Her lifestyle is not so self-centered as Tamamo-no-Mae’s or Kiyohime’s, but that doesn’t mean she dislikes happy-go-lucky people inherently, although she does not necessarily approve of them outright either.

She may behave like a fair and composed judge, but she is actually a loyal sparrow who cherishes all favors granted to her as treasures.
