### Bond 5

#### Star Basket (Large): EX

The first technique of Enjaku Sewing. The wicker box gift.
Two wicker boxes are withdrawn from sage garments and opened.
The large box is about one meter long, and the smaller box is about 30 centimeters.

The wicker box given to the enemy party inflicts various types of bad luck―negative effects―on them, but at the same time it slightly recovers their HP. No matter how much she abhors the enemy, Beni-Enma never forgets that it must retain its original nature as a gift.

#### Star Basket (Small): EX

The second technique of Enjaku Sewing. The wicker box gift.
The blessing of the sparrow that was awarded to the honest old man.

It brings about good luck to her own party, and it also recovers HP. Wait…that sounds too good to be true.
But for some reason, it also slightly restores the enemy’s HP.
No matter how much leverage it should give to her own party, Beni-Enma still prepares it as a gift for all.
