Juu-Ou Hanketsu Tsuzura No Michiyuki.
Third secret technique of Enjaku Sewing Battoujutsu.
A wicker box of calamity is summoned and unsealed. A parade of one hundred oni (actually sparrows) manifests to confuse the enemy and drag them within the box. The box is then taken to a banquet hall where sparrows, taking on the appearance of the Ten Kings of Hell (rulers of the dead, of which King Enma is one), wait to make their judgment. The enemy then receives Beni-Enma’s sword stroke of sentencing. This Noble Phantasm is especially damaging to those of the “Chaotic” and “Evil” alignments.
