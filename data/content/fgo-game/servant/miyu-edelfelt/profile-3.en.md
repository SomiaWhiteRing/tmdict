### Bond 3

In truth, she is a God Child from a parallel world.

She was born to the Sakatsuki, a house held in high esteem since the Tenshou era (around the late 1500s) in Fuyuki, and she possessed the power to grant peoples’ wishes. As such, she is known as a God Child. She grew up sheltered and with no outside contact until she reached seven years old, the age at which her abilities are said to fade away.

Throughout history, members of the Sakatsuki, without exception, abandoned their own desires to simply wish for the happiness of the child. The fact that the most natural and obvious human and parental behavior continued for more than five hundred years was a miracle in itself greater even than the God Child.
Until…

Right before the God Child of the latest generation, Miyu, reached her seventh year, an unknown phenomenon in Fuyuki called the “Erosion Incident” caused the Sakatsuki house to collapse. Kiritsugu and Shirou, traveling the world in search of a miracle, found Miyu in the rubble, and took her under their wing.
