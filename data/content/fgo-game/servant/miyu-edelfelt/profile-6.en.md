### Bond 5

She could not live a normal life. She was merely a vessel who granted people’s wishes. Her tremendous intellect enabled her to understand her role and purpose: that she is unnecessary, that she is only a tool. And then a young man named Shirou, who wanted simply to be her older brother, saved her…

“I wish for Miyu to be happy.”

It was an older brother’s humble prayer for his younger sister. And that wish is granted…through their separation.

The girl finally learns to stand on her own feet. The ground that her bare feet touched was cold, but the thought of her brother, though a world apart, continues to warm Miyu’s heart.
