### Bond 3

#### Femme Fatale (Fake): A

A skill that enables her to naturally slip right next to her target. This indicates her proficiency in the preliminary investigation needed for a phantom thief, and it’s a compound skill that includes analysis, intelligence, the use of pheromones, disguise, covert action, and more.

Her demonic nature makes anyone, male or female, naturally fall in love with her as she gets close to them when she goes in for a steal. But the feeling is but an illusion that persists only until her thieving is done. No matter how precious, compatible, and comfortable that love may seem, it will never truly go anywhere, no matter how much the other person may wish it. Even…if she herself wishes it.
