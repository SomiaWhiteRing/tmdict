### Bond 4

#### Thief’s Calling Card: A

A most bold card left by the mysterious female thief “Mistress C” before she carries out her crime. It bears an image of some sort of canine symbol, as well as messages like, “On this day at this time, I will come take 〇〇.” The described act is always carried out flawlessly.

The act of sending a calling card creates a unique feeling of ecstasy…or rather a form of catharsis. But be warned: once she gets hooked on doing this, she’ll keep on throwing cards at you during ordinary conversations.

#### Mistress C: EX

A skill that changes Swimsuit Celebrity Madam Carmilla into a mysterious thief called Mistress C. Generally nobody knows her true identity.

“Her appearance is simply graceful…so elegant… And just so sexy… (sigh)”

Mistress C is a terrifyingly sexy lady with vast knowledge of myriad advanced gadgets, a body to die for, skills at the wheel of her bright red car that would make racers green with envy, and has A LITTLE bit of skill in torture.

She prefers not to kill on her heists, not because she has any interest in justice or the like, but because she thinks that if she hears the screams of her victims, she might get a bit…distracted.
