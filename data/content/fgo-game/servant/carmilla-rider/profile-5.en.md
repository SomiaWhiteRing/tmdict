Iron Maiden Tearing through the Night Darkness.
As she jumps into the red luxury car reshaped from her Iron Maiden, she drives like an elegant celebrity, attacking by running her targets over. In other words, this car itself is the Iron Maiden, according to Swimsuit Carmilla.
“Testarossa” means “red head” in Italian, and it has nothing to do with the luxury sports car of the same name.
Probably.

The torture device originally was not so much a physical item she carried around, but rather an illusion, and so its general concept doesn’t change even after it transforms into something else entirely. The illusion that she freely manipulates simply got an extreme face-lift. That it would make the faces of the virgins to whom she is attracted twist in horror, that it would make others scream, and that once you…take it for a spin, nobody can get out, conceptually, this all remains the same.

No matter how beautiful and famous the noblewoman may appear, young ladies really, REALLY shouldn’t get in her car. Their bodies and souls will be taken, and they’ll never get out… Well, it could just be a sort of urban legend…
