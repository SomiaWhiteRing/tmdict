Delusional Heartbeat.
Cursed arm. The arm of evil spirit Shaytan, it excels in cursing humans to death.
Using a block of ether and a mirror image of the assassination target, it creates a secondary existence which affects the actual target.
By crushing the fake image that resonates with the assassination target, he curses the target to death without laying a finger on the actual target.
