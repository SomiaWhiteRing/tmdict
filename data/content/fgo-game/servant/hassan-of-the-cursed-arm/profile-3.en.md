### Bond 3

He cannot be called a good man, but he is faithful to his Masterâ€™s orders.
He never betrays the one acknowledged as Master no matter how terrible the situation gets.
He silently obeys orders even if they are somewhat unreasonable.
He deems killing as his role or his obligation, and does not feel much grief or pleasure from it.
