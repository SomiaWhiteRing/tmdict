Releasing the Second Best Shot.
The secondary Noble Phantasm that gets unleashed in case the unmissable first Noble Phantasm misses.
This is based on the legend of Tell hiding a second bolt to shoot the evil Vogt Gessler in case Tell missed the apple on top of his son’s head.
This bolt is released immediately after the first bolt misses. In other words, this is a Noble Phantasm that conceptually exists simultaneously with the first shot. This does not get activated if the first bolt properly hits.

Tell’s thought process is simply: “Everyone will die if I miss the (first target) apple, so if that happens, I’ll need to shoot down the (second target) Vogt who gave the order,” and the target is determined based on the situation.
It can target the same object as the first shot, and it can similarly intervene with the laws of causality to hit the target without fail.
However, rapid firing is difficult since this consumes excessive amounts of magical energy.
Though, the first shot is said to always hit, and so this second shot situation is pretty rare.
