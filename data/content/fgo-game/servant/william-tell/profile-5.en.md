Releasing the First Shot of Faith.
Means “apple shooter.”
The legendary single shot that managed to pierce the apple atop Tell’s son’s head.
The single shot that carried the son’s full trust for his father and his ability to never miss, piercing the target without fail.
The legendary story that sublimated into a Noble Phantasm even intervenes with the laws of causality, and it’s normally impossible to evade.
