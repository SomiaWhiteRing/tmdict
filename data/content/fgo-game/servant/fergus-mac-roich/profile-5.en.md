### Bond 5

According to a geis formed with Cú Chulainn, the next time the two meet in battle, Fergus will unconditionally win.
During the second Ulster Invasion, Queen Medb decided that Fergus would be an obstacle in her plan to enact revenge upon Cú Chulainn, and did not invite Fergus to battle.
Afterwards, Medb’s jealous husband, King Ailill, assassinated him.
