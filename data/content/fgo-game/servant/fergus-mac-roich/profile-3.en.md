### Bond 3

Tradition says that a light sprang out like a rainbow and destroyed the hill, and this aspect of the weapon is retained in its nature as a Noble Phantasm.
In other words, its massive destructive power can shatter the Earth itself.
It has been said that, in later ages, it became the model for the magic swords and sacred swords that many heroes obtained.
Also, the model of Excalibur Galatine.
The sword is nicknamed “Rainbow Sword” because of this legend.
