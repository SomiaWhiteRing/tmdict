### Clear Main Quest 「Second Knot」

Circe was approached by the sea god Glaucus for romantic advice, but fell in love with him herself. After he rejected her, Circe transformed his love Scylla into a monster in a fit of jealousy. Scylla later ate six of Odysseus’s crew.

The hero Odysseus stopped by the island of Aeaea on his way home and was offered a poisoned barley drink, but he managed to break free of her magic with the divine protection of Hermes. This impressed Circe, and when it was time for Odysseus to leave the island, she gave him helpful advice to avoid trouble on his journey.
