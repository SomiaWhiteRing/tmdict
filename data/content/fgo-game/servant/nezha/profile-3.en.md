Nezha’s scorching charge attack propels her into the sky using acceleration from the Wind Fire Wheels. She then becomes one with her spear and rushes the enemy at full speed.
It is a powerful technique designed for the decisive battle against Sun Wukong, the Great Sage, Heaven’s Equal. As a Lancer, Nezha uses this technique to draw out the maximum strength of her Noble Phantasm, the Fire-Tipped Spear.
