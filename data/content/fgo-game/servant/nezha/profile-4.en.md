### Bond 4

Nezha is neither human nor a sage. She was born from a jewel sent to earth by Taiyi Zhenren, the sage of the Kunlun Mountains.
In addition to the Universe Ring and Red Armillary Sash that Nezha possessed at birth as her Baobei (treasured objects), Taiyi Zhenren presented Nezha with new Baobei at every opportunity. Among them were the Demon-Slicing Sword, the Demon-Hacking Blade, the Demon-Tying Rope, the Demon-Defeating Pestle, the Embroidered Sphere, the Wind Fire Wheels, and the Fire-Tipped Spear.

Growing up on earth, Nezha was not evil, but she was still something of a ruffian. When a god scolded her for polluting a river, Nezha killed the god, and even killed a higher ranking god. She was scolded for her actions, and it seemed disaster would befall her earthly parents, so she took her own life.
