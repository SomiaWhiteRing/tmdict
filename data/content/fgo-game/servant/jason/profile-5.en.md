The Radiant Ship that Tears the Heavens.
Aid received from the Argo, where the heroes aboard execute a coordinated attack.
The better standing Jason has, the greater both the crew’s unity and the number of attacks made.
In contrast, if he is seen as a villain, the ship will suffer from the sabotage of being “surprisingly” empty, and the Noble Phantasm’s strength will drastically decrease.
