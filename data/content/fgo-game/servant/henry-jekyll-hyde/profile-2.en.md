### Bond 2

#### Jekyll

An honest, intelligent, good man - the original personality.
His tendency to overthink things is both his greatest virtue and flaw.
Despite his peaceful appearance, he has a strong sense of justice.
In life he struggled with and challenged the “evil that lurks within humans.”
