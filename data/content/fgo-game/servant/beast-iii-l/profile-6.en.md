The Realm of Love, The Burning Universe.
The Noble Phantasm exclusive to Beast III/L. Unusually, it has two True Names. This is to indicate that they are two sides of the same coin. The word saṃsāra means “cycle” in Sanskrit, and it’s derived from Kama’s other name, Samsaraguru. Avaruddha in Sanskrit means “obstruction,” and it points to Mara’s many attempts to interfere with Buddha…the temptation towards corruption.

Coercing the indulgences of love that are both good and bad… The ultimate corruptive Noble Phantasm that represents both Kama and Mara, who possess demonic natures on a cataclysmic level. When one experiences this Noble Phantasm inside Kama’s universe, they will undoubtedly behold a true hell—or perhaps paradise—of Kama sending herself (or copies of herself) to all without discrimination, and burning up the universe with her one-sided love to exhaust her targets.
