### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

Originally a Divided Spirit who was only a part of the Divine Spirit Kama/Mara, this Pseudo-Servant manifested by borrowing a human form. While it may not have been a conscious move, the body of the vessel was split into good and evil by Pārvatī. Thus, this version of Kama incarnated in the evil aspect of the body. This is also why the Servant turned out as a female deity.
