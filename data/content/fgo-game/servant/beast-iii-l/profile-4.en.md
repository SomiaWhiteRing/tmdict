### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

#### Authority of Beasts: A

Also called an “anti-humanity” skill.
As an Assassin, Kama does not possess this skill.
…Or perhaps it secretly belongs to Mara.

#### Accepting All Greed: EX

Normally, Kama/Mara is prepared both physically and ability-wise on multiple levels in order to ready herself for the endless human greed (lust) that covers this world. And now, with the inclusion of the universe, which is truly boundless, its next-level countermeasures came into being by targeting something very specific.

It’s an Authority that is able to specifically target the greed (lust) of each and every person in the universe, indulges them, and corrupts them. The theory is that the Authority is readily customizable, and just like the infinite number of stars in space, there are an endless number of selves that can deal with all.

In other words, Kama/Mara exists infinitely within the universe that is herself.

#### Nega-Desire: A

A potent skill unique and native to the Beast of Desire. No matter the target, anything that has even a modicum of greed will be corrupted by love itself. If all desire and lust that exist in the universe can be granted through infinite love, that would also mean that the concept of greed can be eliminated from this universe.
