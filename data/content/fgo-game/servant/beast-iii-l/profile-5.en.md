### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

She was mandated to be intimately involved with the love affairs of all the world, and was annihilated after getting involved in said affairs… The god of love, as a result, gained infinity, and naturally became weary of love. Thus, she tries to fulfill everything using her own infinite love. After all, if the universe (humanity) is fulfilled by her love, then there would be no further annoyance of the love affairs between people that so irk her.

This Beast scatters passion (or arrows of it) throughout humanity that are sufficient to burn the universe. Anything goes. It doesn’t matter how low they stoop. Love them through and through even if they are corrupted to the point of becoming animals. Embrace them. That kind of ultimate pampering is what Kama/Mara can offer. She offers love (temptation) as she once did for Buddha…but now to each and every person of this universe.

“The vow to cut off all vexations…must be so hard on you. Don’t worry, I’ll burn all your worries away.”

The sight of her enjoying herself by scorning the Buddha’s vow with a smile is the very image of the Demon King, the great enemy in Buddhism.

And so, based on her original nature, her class was determined:
The god of love is a false name.
The byproduct of a god of evil…the greatest catastrophe that is said to save humanity itself.
Her name: Beast III/L.
She is one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, the Beast possessing the aspect of lust.
