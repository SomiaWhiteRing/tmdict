### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

The typical ratio of Kama and Mara is 6:4, but when the proportion heavily leans towards Mara, the Spirit Origin awakens as a Beast. While Kama gained a physical body of the universe, that also meant that her counterpart, the Demon King Mara, also gained the power of the boundless realm (universe). The Demon King of lust connected to the universe simultaneously as the god of love did so, which resulted in a horrendous catastrophe. Kama thus became a manifestation of calamity, a being that the universe itself with love and desire, which meant she was more than qualified to become the immature form of a Beast capable of destroying humanity.
Beast III/R, the Beast of lust, is among the Seven Evils of Humanity to have already  manifested. And then, as various chain of events connected…

While sharing the same principles of lust, unlike the Beast that directs all love to herself, this Kama/Mara goes the complete opposite direction. She manifests as an immature Beast that gives love to all…by taking away love (normally directed to humans who are loved).
