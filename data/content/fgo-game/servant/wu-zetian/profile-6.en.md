### Clear Main Quest 「Women of Agartha」

Wu Zetian was surprisingly superstitious.
She liked to change the names of dynasties and titles not only because she liked new things, but also due to that superstitious nature.
When Consort Xiao was on the verge of death, she cursed Wu: “You will be reincarnated as a rat. I will be a cat and bite you to death!” Since then, Wu forbade cats within the palace.
She even moved the nation’s capital from Chang’an to Luoyang because she was afraid of a ghost…

“H-hey! Revealing my weaknesses is cruel… I mean…that information is a complete lie! I’m not afraid of cats or ghosts…just…argh! To the wine pot with you!”
