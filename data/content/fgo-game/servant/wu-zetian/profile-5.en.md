The Manual of Accusation is an instruction book for the Torturers said to have been written during Wu’s rule. It is essentially a how-to guide for interrogation and torture with the aim of forcing the victim to admit themselves a criminal.

This Noble Phantasm is an embodiment of her national law, where it is solely her judgment that determines who is and who is not a criminal. In other words, whenever this NP is used, everyone and anything is deemed appropriate for torture in her eyes, and the target will be tortured without any real choice.

Normally she has various methods of torturing her victims, but recently she exclusively uses a version of the wine pot and poison torture she once used against her political enemies.
