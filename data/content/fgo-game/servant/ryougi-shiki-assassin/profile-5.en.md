### Bond 5

The Ryougi family has been around for centuries.
For generations, they have studied the creation of the “perfect human body.”
For this perfect body, “ego” is not needed.
All it needs are interchangeable personalities (software), and an all-purposed body that can handle commands (hardware).
This belief, this faith of theirs has been proven over hundreds of years of trials.
But, her existence is quite different than the one they had in mind.

As a result, she has become the current heir of the Ryougi family.
That is who Ryougi Shiki is.
