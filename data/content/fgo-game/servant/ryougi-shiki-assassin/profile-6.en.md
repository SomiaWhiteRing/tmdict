### Clear 「5th Floor, Room No.4」

At a glance, she seems cold and hard to get along with.
Although she speaks and behaves in a masculine way, she’s very girlish at heart and slightly different than “a beautiful woman in a man’s suit.”
She tries to act like an outlaw, but deep down she’s mature and longs for companionship.
Because of that, she will take care of anyone she takes a liking to.
As to why she talks and behaves like a man, or why she’s particularity harsh toward people with split personalities, please refer to “the Garden of sinners” novels or anime.
