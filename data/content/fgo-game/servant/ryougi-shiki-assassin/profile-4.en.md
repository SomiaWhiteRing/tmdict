By focusing her sight into the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, she can see the “lines of death” for her enemies and sever them.
No matter if your life lasts billions of years.
No matter if you can heal instantly.
No matter if you have hundreds of lives.
Since the Eye reveals the target’s “concept of death,” even the so-called immortals will suffer critical damage.

Even if a life is not likely to know death, no life can escape death.
The End is the same for all things in existence.
