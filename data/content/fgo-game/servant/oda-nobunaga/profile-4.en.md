### Bond 4

#### 『Three Line Formation』

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>E-A</td></tr>
  <tr><td>NP Type</td><td>Anti-Army</td></tr>
</table>

The firing formation employed at Nagashino.
Summons 3,000 matchlock rifles that fire at once. Manifested from the tale of Oda defeating the strongest cavalry of the entire Warring States period.
Increases damage against enemies with “Riding” skills.
Even those without “Riding” skills won’t exactly enjoy getting hit by the simultaneous blasts.
