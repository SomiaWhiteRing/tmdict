### Bond 5

Nobunaga called herself the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, which is the name of the demon king who ruled over the world of greed in Buddhism.
Her cruel acts in life, such as burning the temples of Mt. Hiei, and the fear and awe later generations felt towards her have caused her to appear in the form of a Demon King.
