### Bond 3

#### Unifying the Nation by Force: A

A special skill given to Nobunaga, who was the revolutionary of her era.
A conceptual revolution that will overwrite the old with the new. When against opponents that have high-rank “Divinity” or “Mystic,” or against Heroic Spirits who protect their own traditions, Nobunaga will receive positive adjustment to her stats depending on the number of the opponents. On the contrary, her skill effects and Noble Phantasm strength will decrease against modern Heroic Spirits.
