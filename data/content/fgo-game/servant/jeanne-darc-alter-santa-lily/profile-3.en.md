### Bond 3

Her personality is, if anything, closer to the original Jeanne.
She is serious to a fault, uncompromising, and sometimes does crazy things. If she has to, she’s willing to resort to breaking the law. And even if she doesn’t have to, she’ll sometimes break the law if it’s more efficient.

What makes her different from the real Jeanne is that when she panics, she’ll start running around before breaking down into tears, and generally causing chaos around her. According to her, watching the grown-up Jeanne Alter play the role of bad girl is embarrassing.

“She still seems embarrassed by the fact that she’s become a Servant and doesn’t know how to interact with Master. She’s so silly!”

…is only the beginning of what she has to say on the subject.
But for her own part, she wants her Master to spoil her, but doesn’t know how to ask. In that sense, she really is the same Jeanne Alter.
