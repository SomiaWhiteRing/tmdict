### Clear 「7th Night: Last Present For You」

Jeanne d’Arc had a sense of duty given to her by divine revelation.
Jeanne Alter had her desire for revenge, born of despair.
However, Jeanne Alter Santa Lily has neither of these.
Humanity’s instability just barely allowed her to exist, but even so, she normally wouldn’t have been able to survive past Christmas.
She is truly a miracle of the holy night.

The young girl tried to become Santa Claus to prove that she was useful, but there was no real need for that.
All she had to do was wait to receive a present.
Someone close to her would have delivered one to her.

…But as she was born without any greed, she didn’t understand presents, or even that she herself could ever receive one.
A stern, harsh, and vast sea. A tiny little wish that had long since vanished from the memories of the adult Jeanne.
Perhaps it was different than what she thought it would be.
But her wish did come true.
The moment when she understands that she can exist in this world when her wish comes true, that will be when her story begins.
