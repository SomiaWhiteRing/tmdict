### Bond 4

#### Saint’s Gift: C

A skill earned by playing the role of Santa Claus.
She gives presents to warm others’ hearts.
Her rank is quite high for a rookie Santa; from a Santa perspective, her earnest approach and hard work may have made up for her inexperience.

#### Self-Transformation: A

A Servant is normally summoned at the height of their powers, but she is an exception, summoned in order to grow and mature.
If she wishes to become evil, she will become evil, and if she wishes to be good, she will become good.
Her future may not be a bright one, but the light of the saint will be given to her if she wishes for it.
