### Bond 4

Archer Nightingale believes that all the world’s sweets should turn into medicine (like cold medicine that’s sweet). However, she does not believe wishes should be made upon the Holy Grail, and so strives to carry this out herself.

If someone asks, “Don’t you mean you want all the world’s medicine to turn into sweets?” her reply would surely be, “Why! Should! Medicine! Turn! Into! Sweets!?”

She really is a stickler on this topic.

“The concept of sweets changing into medicine contains some element of fantasy. But medicine should remain medicine.”
