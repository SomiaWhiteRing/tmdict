### Bond 5

She has a bit of an off-the-rails perception of most things, and she remains entirely focused on no-nonsense medical treatment…which means her behavior is no different than the normal Heroic Spirit Nightingale’s. However, upon closer observation, you may realize that she speaks rather more modestly than usual. While it is not altogether frequent, she does sometimes voice more romantic notions. This is because Archer Nightingale contains fragments of her younger mind, before she spent time in the medical field. In consequence, she evinces more of her well-bred background than she does in her Berserker manifestation.

It was Nursery Rhyme’s meddling that had caused Nightingale’s Spirit Origin to change. After a series of incidents, Archer Nightingale has come to accept her youthful self. Her acceptance should therefore allow her to work well as the new Santa Servant. In particular, she will continue to fight for to improve sanitary and nursing conditions and to combat myriad illnesses…all while praying during  the Holy Night.

…So essentially she’s still the same person?
Maybe she is, and maybe she isn’t.
