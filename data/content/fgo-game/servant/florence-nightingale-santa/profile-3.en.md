### Bond 3

#### Assault Medicine: C+

The gun-like syringe Archer Nightingale carries around is used like a projectile weapon, firing ampoules containing various medicine at a rate of twenty ampoules per second. Those targeted by her treatments recover instantly. Those targeted for disinfection or sterilization sustain reduced damage. This particular Noble Phantasm is continuously active, but in this game it counts as a skill.

#### Bell Rung by an Angel on the Holy Night: EX

Archer Nightingale may not evince any enthusiasm for Christmas, but her very being is closely tied to the Holy Night. Her crimson outfit and the golden bell fastened on a travelers bag is proof of this connection. Then again, Nightingale has no recollection of why she wears or carries such things, claiming that she did not realize she had them.
