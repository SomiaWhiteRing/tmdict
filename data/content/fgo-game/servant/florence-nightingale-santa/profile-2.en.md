### Bond 2

#### Independent Action: A+

A skill that enables her to be autonomous for a while even without Master supplying magical energy. She is able to fight against injury and illness on her own if duty calls.

#### Madness Enhancement: EX

Ranks up all her parameters, but strips away much of her sanity. It’s unclear whether this happened because the qualities of her original Berserker Spirit Origin were retained, or if it was that the hero Nightingale’s characteristics remained. She may be more mild-mannered in her speech than she was as a Berserker, but her conversational style hasn’t really changed much.
