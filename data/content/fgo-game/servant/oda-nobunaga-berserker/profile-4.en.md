### Bond 4

#### Fool’s Tactic: A

A inconceivably foolish tactic used for battle.
She may ding-dong ditch at a temple, or put firecrackers in tea kettles, or even make Nobukatsu cry. Really, it’s just her doing whatever the hell she wants.
Ironically, she’s quite brilliant when it comes to strategies like this, which bolsters her close-combat abilities.

#### Atsumori Beat: B

A super special dancing Atsumori cheer where the beat of Atsumori echoes across the battlefield. It’d be nice to know whether this was a dance or a song, but that’s rock, according to Nobbu. 

As a side note, the mysterious armed Demon King’s name is “Heshi-Kill Hasebe.”
