### Bond 5

Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga.

Her normal Demon King of the Sixth Heaven state is so dangerous, she risks burning up the gods, or even herself. And so, by sealing herself into the Berserker class, she manages to maintain her Demon King of the Sixth Heaven state.
She may be concealing it with foolish statements, but this form is pretty dangerous for Nobunaga, so she periodically releases (shouts) her magical energy (rock) to cool down.
…Well, it can’t be helped!
