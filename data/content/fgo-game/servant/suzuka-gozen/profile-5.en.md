### Bond 5

#### Blessings of Talent: C

A skill that would normally be a Noble Phantasm.
By equipping the Shoutouren, a sword said to have been forged by the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, her INT is increased greatly.
Her once sloppy swordsmanship becomes refined, and her grasp of tactics expands greatly. In addition, this skill increases the performance of the “Demonic Sun-Shower,” and allows the use of “Sanzen Daisensekai.” It may sound like a pretty overpowered skill, but since it requires more thinking than necessary, Suzuka Gozen lapses into a temporary state of self-loathing because she plays a high school girl who lives an incompetent life. That’s why Suzuka Gozen does not proactively use this skill.

#### Sanzen Daisensekai: EX

A skill that would normally be a Noble Phantasm.
This skill represents trichiliocosm, a concept that explains the Buddhist cosmology and understanding of the multiverse.
When the morning light reflects upon Suzuka Gozen’s beloved sword Kenmyouren, the Sanzen Daisensekai appears. Various worlds and even parallel worlds can be created within the sword and be witnessed there.
…The meaning behind all of this is something that Suzuka Gozen never speaks about.
If used for a long period time, her rights as a Heroic Spirit are stripped away.
