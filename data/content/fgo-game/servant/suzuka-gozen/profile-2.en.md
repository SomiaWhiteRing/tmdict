### Bond 2

An intelligent girl who wholeheartedly plays the role of a selfish, simple-minded, and trendy high school girl.
Her original personality, though, is the complete opposite. She is a thoughtful, down to earth, and dignified princess.
As a Demoness of the Heavens, she does have a merciless side, but she is both earnest and prideful in her role and duty.
â€¦On the flip side, her dignified personality and intellect have left her depressed by her villainous roots as the daughter of an oni, which created a sense of self-loathing in her, as well as making her something of a recluse.
She is like a high school class president gifted with both intelligence and beauty, but also a certain melancholy. Her high school girl facade covers up most of her true self.
