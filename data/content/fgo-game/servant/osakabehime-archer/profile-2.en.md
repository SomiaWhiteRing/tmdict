### Bond 2

Okki suddenly found herself wondering: Is this how my life should be?
Her encounter with Master was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so maybe it wouldnâ€™t be such a bad idea if she mustered up her all her courage to try an outdoor mode. And it might be inspiration for her next manga.

And thanks to a certain boxing workout regime created by a boxing Servant who was also one of the original swimsuited Servants, she managed to lose a little bit of weight.
All she has to do is to resist gaining back all the weight during the fall.
