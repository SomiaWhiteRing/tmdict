Hakurojou Senshiki Mirimiri Naito Fiibaa.
A battalion of origami (1000 sheets) that shoots, gives cover, and unleashes bombs.
It’s a truly massive assault!
By the way, milli-mili is short for “million military,” which is meant to represent the amount of origami she used in her Noble Phantasm.
…Okki hasn’t realized that “milli” actually means a thousand. Master understood the moment she explained, but didn’t have the heart to point it out to her.
