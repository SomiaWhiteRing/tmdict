### Bond 3

#### Royal Bunny: A

Take a look at that shiny thing atop the king’s head. What is that!? It’s like the ears of a beast! Could this possibly be from a dreadful beast that once terrorized Britain long ago, inflicting some sort of grudge or curse upon King Arthur!? Ohhh, you terrifying, snarling beast…dare you bare your fangs to the king even after hundreds of years…!?
…No, you are completely mistaken. Our king has shown interest in these beings called bunny girls.
Oh? Does that mean that getup is…?
…That’s right. A costume.
Is that so?

#### Royal Card: C+

The king seems to be throwing some sort of dagger… No, it’s something else. Are those…cards?
…Yes. The king has decreed that a casino dealer must be versed in handling cards.
I hear that this casino is a place for so-called games and amusement.
…That is correct. What of it?
But the way she throws those things, it looks like she’s trying to eliminate enemies.
…Perhaps it is her way of kicking out drunks and other annoying customers.
Is that so…?
