### Bond 2

She is basically the same person as Lancer Altria.
However, since she’s not on duty, she unconsciously believes that she can let loose a little bit, and so at times she makes surprisingly casual comments during the Swimsuit Swordbeauties’ Seven Duels.

As a side note, since she is no longer a Lancer, her horse Dun Stallion is not by her side. It doesn’t mean the white horse has disappeared, as there have been sightings of it resting at Chaldea’s stable. So who’s supplying the magical energy for it to manifest here?
The world may never know.
