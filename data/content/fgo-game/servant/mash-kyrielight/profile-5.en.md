### Bond 4

Mash has acquired the True Name of the Heroic Spirit who possessed her.
The name of that knight is Galahad, one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend.
A saint who was the one person to acquire the Holy Grail, and return it to heaven.
Chaldea used a special method to summon him as a Heroic Spirit.
The core that made this possible was the catalyst used to summon him, “the place where heroes gather” – the shield that Mash holds that uses the Round Table.
