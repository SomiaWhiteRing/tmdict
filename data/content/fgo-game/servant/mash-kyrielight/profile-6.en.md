### Bond 5

After passing through the seven Singularities, and overcoming many battles, she has become a proper human being, and a full-fledged Servant.

The virtual Noble Phantasm, Lord Chaldeas, the True Name of which she is still unable to learn, is the wish that exists at the bottom of her heart.
The wish to “see the future of humanity.”

…The battle to stop the Incineration of Humanity will soon end.
But what will be the conclusion of her journey?
The Beast of the Stars silently watches over her.
