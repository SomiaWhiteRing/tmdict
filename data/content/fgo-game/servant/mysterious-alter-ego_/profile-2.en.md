### Bond 2

A prima donna above the water, figure skating charismatically across the surface. She calls herself the queen of the sea and claims to unleash all manner of waves. She is both an aggressive and merciless queen, dominated almost entirely by her wickedly sadistic side.

She prefers structural beauty, and she is very sensitive to things she finds ugly or otherwise aesthetically unpleasing. Believing herself to be capable of anything, Meltryllis prides herself in her absolute perfection…which really isn’t anything new. But this professional figure skater persona of hers does love hyping an audience up, which…somewhat mitigates her sadistic tendencies.

Her absolute belief in herself as the gold standard for beauty and perfection remains quite unchanged. No matter how beautiful and popular the other swimsuit Swordbeauties are, she will smile elegantly and say, “Is that so? But I’m still the most beautiful, right?”
