The Summer Mist is Like Glass.
According to Lambda, one should read it more as “Summer Is Like a Star.”
The target is restrained inside a water sphere while she dives into the water and swims at high speed with numerous Leviathans, her attendants, by her side. After accelerating, she shoots herself out like a missile to pierce the target still trapped within the sphere.
The Lambdas that jump out to the surface may look like graceful flying fish, or even a legendary spear that could destroy a city.

The Great Sea’s Howl, The Seven Deadly Sins Elegy.
According to Lambda, the “seven deadly sins” should be read as “seven summer sins.” Apparently alliteration is key, and their rarity is high. Heaven and earth are filled with the sea to create a giant tsunami. Those engulfed by the tsunami are all collected in one place by a tornado. They are then trapped inside a spherical water prison, where Meltryllis, now in the form of a completely liquid dragon, bites the sphere, bringing the enemy to a watery grave. The sea that surrounds Las Vegas is made possible by constantly deploying this Noble Phantasm.
