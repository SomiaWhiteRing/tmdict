### Bond 3

She hides her identity because she’s a star. She conceals her private life out of consideration for her passionate fans, and as a sort of reward for them. This is why she is so adamant about claiming not to be Meltryllis, but rather the Mysterious Alter Ego.

Normally she sees no point playing at being charismatic for her sisters (oh really?), but as this Spirit Origin takes the name of the expressionist Lambda, she is a professional through and through.

Leviathan has also made her become envious…at least that’s what’s publicized. However her egotistical attachment and love were always quite…intense, like the pull of a black hole, while her jealous and envious nature has always been there.
