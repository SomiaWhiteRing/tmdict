Even If Death Do Us Part.
The Noble Phantasms of the Alter Egos are unlawfully modified. The Servant used as a template for this one is the Valkyrie Brynhild of the Volsunga Saga, who wielded a lance of love and hate in her quest for revenge against her husband, Sigurd, who tarnished her reputation.
Similarly, Passionlip’s Noble Phantasm also becomes more powerful the deeper her love is. Or rather, it used to.
The heart that once wished for “till death do us part” has softened to “even if death do us part.” 
Parting is inevitable. Whether it comes in the form of a breakup or a betrayal, the love itself is never denied.
“No matter what kind of parting it was, I believe the love we shared was real, and it is forever.”
Just as Lip desired, her power that was once something used to destroy those she loves became something used to protect those she loves.
Truly the pure, innocent, and yet mature power of a saint.
