### Bond 2

Introverted, earnest, and extremely delusional.
Whenever something goes bad, she has a habit of blaming others and shutting herself away.
In CCC, that temperament―her earnestness and inability to be forward with others―was demonstrated in other ways…chiefly in the form of stalking. However, once she acknowledged her mistakes and shortcomings, she learned to restrain her stalkerish tendencies and now strives to work hard and make friends properly. However, her lazy nature (she tends to skip out on working for any reason) has not changed, and she herself realizes that it’s a bad thing and is working to correct that.

#### Cognitive Disorder:

She cannot discern the shape of her own hands.
Her “brain” obscures her ugly appearance, and internally converts it into the arm of a normal girl.
To her, her massive claws looked absolutely normal.
The old Lip did not understand why others feared her, but now she can face her own physical body and accept her monstrous physique.
