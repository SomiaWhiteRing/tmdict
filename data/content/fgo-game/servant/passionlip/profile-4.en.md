### Bond 4

#### High Servant: A

An artificial Servant synthesized from multiple mythological beings. Possesses the essences of Pārvatī, Durga, and Brynhild.

#### Breast Valley: A

Basically a recycle bin.
A function where unneeded data files are stored temporarily. Also called a trash can.
In Passionlip’s case, for some reason, this icon is set in the center of her chest. To put it bluntly, it’s an imaginary dimensional pocket that can contain an incredible amount of trash.
If it’s waste data that Passionlip has compressed, an infinite amount can be stored, regardless of file size.
At first glance, this seems like a handy function, but since waste data cannot go back to its original form, it is in fact totally useless. It is believed that Passionlip acquired such special configurations because she is the type of girl who keeps her emotions buried deep inside and eventually breaks down and injures herself.

In CCC, one is said to never be able to come back once they fall into this valley of death, but in FGO, it’s possible for the contracted Master to be fished out.
