### Bond 5

#### Masochistic Nature: A

Passionlip’s id_es skill.
During group battles, she directs all the enemy’s hate toward herself and increases her chance of becoming the target of attack.

#### Trash and Crush: EX

Id_es. A cheat skill that evolved from “Monstrous Strength.”
No matter how giant the file size is, it can be smashed and compressed with her claws if it can be grasped within her hands.
Compressed items turn into cubes one centimeter to a side, but their mass can only be lightened to a tenth of their pre-compressed state. Compressed items are then treated as waste data.
The only things that can be compressed are things smaller than Lip’s hands…
Actually, no. Anything she sees and believes can fit in her hands can be treated as a target.
It’s a flat physical interference that ignores perspective, but the bigger the file, the more time it takes to compress. It’s a compression technique (codec) that’s like an illusion fit for the digital realm.
Lip specializes in destruction, and if the opponent doesn’t move, such as landscapes and buildings, she can demonstrate destructive power far beyond even BB’s.
On the other hand, if the opponent is a Servant or Master, they immediately sense danger and flee from Lip’s peripheral vision. The sluggish Lip can’t catch up.
