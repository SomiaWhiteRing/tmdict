### Bond 5

While Meltryllis is a girl in love with love, Passionlip is a girl in pursuit of love. However, as she was never loved due to her appearance, the love that she desperately sought went unrequited and eventually turned to hatred. 
Thus Passionlip was born as the Alter Ego of love and hate, and yet not a trace of such characteristics remains in Lip as she is now. As her original personality was submissive to begin with, she has become more like the girl BB was based on after her change of heart.

Lip is aware that she is an extremely dangerous and troublesome Servant. Because of that, she is grateful to her Master for remaining by her side nonetheless.
Such feelings of gratitude eventually change into deep affection and adoration, and ultimately she will believe herself to be in love.
…Yet, since Lip is very aware of her qualities and background, she is no longer able to innocently pursue love.
If she falls in love…if she acts on her love, she will hurt this kind person. That’s why she is going to simply continue to dream, and continue to support her Master.
