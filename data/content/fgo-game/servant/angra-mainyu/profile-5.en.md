### Bond 5

#### 『Verg Avesta』

Falsely Transcribed Creation.
A pseudograph copy of the Avesta, the Zoroastrian scripture.
A primitive curse that returns wounds suffered by its wielder to their opponent.
…Which sounds great, but any fatal wound will kill him before it can activate, which means that he needs a wound “just barely less than fatal” for it to work. He cannot defeat enemies on his own, and after using this Noble Phantasm, he needs a partner to defeat the enemy for him. Truly the weakest.
