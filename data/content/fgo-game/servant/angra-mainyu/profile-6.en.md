### Clear Interlude 「Unlimited Raise/Dead」

In this dualistic cosmology, Aŋra Mainiiu is the only evil.
In other words, he is all the evil in the world.
That was how he was treated, and as a result of this, he saved the villagers from evil. For if evil is him, the villagers must be good.
For this deed, he was summoned as a Heroic Spirit.
A nameless victim. Despite accomplishing no great deeds, or much of anything at all, ironically the wish of the Grail turned him into a true evil (Aŋra Mainiiu).
Given the Servant System divides spirits into classes based on past concepts. He is the extreme exception to the rules.
