### Bond 2

“Jetpack User’s Manual: Normal Form”
A miraculous gadget that uses Mysterious Universe technology. Super acceleration and super braking using Ether Jet propulsion enables dimensional control on a galactic level. A Kiku-ichimonji Blade, a Photon Vulcan, and Photon Missiles are its standard loadout.

“Jetpack User’s Manual: Secondary Form”
A special espionage device that fully extracts her potential and performance. Various functions fit for assassination such as a stealth mode and Wolf of Mibu-style instant assassination techniques are equipped.

This is a new type of jersey-style haori costume that combines the loose-fitting wear of a jersey and the stealthy zigzag pattered black haori. The Kiku-ichimonji Blade version β is included as an interchangeable part.

Still confused after reading all that? Don’t sweat it. I don’t know what’s going on with this either.

Oh, also, there is supposedly a wonderful and invincible summer swimsuit Okita mode that completely conceals all her equipment. This is the recommended mode when going out to play.
