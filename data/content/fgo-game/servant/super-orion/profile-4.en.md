### Bond 4

The sun god Apollo did not approve of his younger sister Artemis falling in love with Orion, and so he tricked Artemis into shooting Orion, who was out at sea, by challenging her to shoot a man named Candaon. Artemis successfully hit her lover, Orion, and it was said that she hugged his corpse and wept.
She considered asking for help from Asclepius, who was able to revive the dead, but he was killed by Zeus’s thunderbolt before she could reach him. With no other choice, Artemis sublimated Orion to the stars.

During winter, three dazzling stars (the Tri-Star) can be seen. They are known as Orion’s Belt.
