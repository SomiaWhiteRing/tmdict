The Moon Goddess’s Innocent Love.
Artemis’s love pours down upon Orion, temporarily enhancing him. The incredible intensity of her love is felt both physically and psychologically.
It is an anti-army Noble Phantasm because its blessing is sufficient to grant one man the strength of an entire army. The sheer magnitude of its power would cause a normal person to explode, but Orion only suffers muscle aches.
