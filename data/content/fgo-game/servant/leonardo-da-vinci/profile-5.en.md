### Bond 5

The third Heroic Spirit summoned by Chaldea.
This Servant was summoned when the Heroic Spirit Summoning System FATE was still in its experimental phase.
Due to the system instability, Da Vinci was supposed to disappear immediately, but decided to stay after taking an interest in the story of Chaldea and being convinced by Romani Archaman.
Da Vinci created a copy of her body, and by claiming that body to be her “Master,” Da Vinci was able to stay materialized in this world. That little stunt is similar to a certain puppeteer somewhere.
