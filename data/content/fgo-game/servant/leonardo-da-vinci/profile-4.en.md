The Universal Person.
The legendary concept of universality turns into form.
Analyze the target in an instant, adjust one’s own maximum output and release it against the target.
This is what people might call an almighty special Noble Phantasm.
Originally this Noble Phantasm can temporary reconstruct an enemy’s Noble Phantasm and thus reflecting it, but the resource needed for that ability is currently being rerouted to operate Chaldea.
