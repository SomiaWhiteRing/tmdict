### Bond 2

Rama was born a wise ruler, but a plot by his relatives stripped him of his claim to the throne and drove him from his homeland.
His beloved wife Sita, who traveled with him, was stolen by the rakshasa Ravana, and Rama devoted himself to getting her back.
Rama was given many weapons by many gurus, and for 14 years he traveled with an army of monkeys, led by the famous Hanuman, as he battled Ravana and his armies.
