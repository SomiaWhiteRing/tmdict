### Bond 5

“Justice by the stars means…a suplex!”

As she has ever been the embodiment of justice for humanity, she will not hesitate to assist in humanity’s restoration. Should she have a Master who still has room to grow, she is all the more enthusiastic, believing that it is her duty to guide them. Her vessel’s personality also factors into this, and so the Servant is quite stern with regards to her Master’s demeanor. If her Master is vulgar, she will not hold back in coaching them (through physical means, including drop-kicks). For Masters who wish to stand alongside her, it would be best not to neglect their training.
