### Bond 3

Originally, her functional aspects were more pronounced, and she was a good deal sterner and more uncompromising. However, her vessel’s influence has softened her and now she tries to guide humanity personally. The same influence can be attributed to her insistence upon hand-to-hand combat. She may wield a sword and scales, but in a fight, she will simply toss them away to engage in techniques most often seen in professional wrestling, which she sees as her true justice. Whether this was unfortunate or simply inevitable when her vessel was chosen is not clear, but the fact of the matter is that the girl’s style matched Astraea’s unparalleled toughness as a Divine Spirit of judgment, ultimately becoming the most prominent Servant for unarmed combat.
