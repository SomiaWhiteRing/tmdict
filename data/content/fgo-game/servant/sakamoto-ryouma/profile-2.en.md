### Bond 2

Sakamoto Ryouma, the Hero of Reform.
A well-known Heroic Spirit on par with Oda Nobunaga. In this Holy Grail War in Japan, he is a powerful Servant with a specialized riding Noble Phantasm.

To conceal his True Name, he typically speaks in standard Japanese, but his Tosa dialect inadvertently slips out at times.

His companion Oryou isnâ€™t the historical person, but rather she is some sort of entity that was bound to a certain mountain by a seal. Ryouma, in his youthful ardor, pulled out the lance that acted as the seal.
