Like a Dragon Soaring Through the Heavens.
She normally appears in the guise of a black-haired woman going by the name “Oryou.” But the moment the True Name is revealed, she transforms into a giant dragon, making this an autonomous humanoid type of Noble Phantasm.

Even when she is in human form, Oryou possesses Monstrous Strength and fighting abilities on par with many Servants, and her Divinity grants her extraordinary defense that makes her impervious to normal attacks. When the True Name is revealed, she becomes a majestic dragon, unleashing overwhelming power. The EX rank is used to mean it’s indeterminable.
