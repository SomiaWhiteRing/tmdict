### Bond 2

In proper history, she was born in Oohara, Sakushu, which is now part of Mimasaka City in Okayama Prefecture. She was born in the year 1584. 
Her father was an instructor of martial arts who served the Shinmen clan, the lords of Takayama castle. The Shinmen clan granted him the right to use the Shinmen name, and so he called himself Shinmen Munisai. Shinmen Munisai had a dojo that taught the use of the jitte in Miyamoto village in Yoshinosato, which became Musashiâ€™s homeland. For this reason, she calls herself Miyamoto Musashi.
She would later go on to leave behind many legends, especially during her twenties, when she fought many other warriors. To this day, these great duels are a staple of entertainment.
However, the truth about most of the episodes that took place during the decade of her twenties is unknown, and many of them are believed to be fictional.
