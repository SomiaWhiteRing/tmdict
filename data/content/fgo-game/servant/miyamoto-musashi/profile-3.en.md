### Bond 3

A female swordmaster who is bright, cheerful, and dignified, yet vibrant.
She always has a grin on her face like she’s in total control, but she does not look down on her opponents. She is just enjoying life.
She just laughs at most of life’s problems, but deep down, she is a woman who strives to master the path of the blade. For this reason, she can be restrained and tough on others when it comes to taking lives.

That aside, she falls in love easily, and loves it when people rely on her.
She also loves compliments and is easily swayed by flattery. A woman who loves a good fight, she has a strong sense of justice, but never boasts about it.
She’s normally an easygoing wanderer, but in the face of a one-sided slaughter, someone who is toying with people’s pride or beliefs for entertainment, or in the case of stealing her food when she is hungry, she becomes an unstoppable foe.
