### Bond 4

#### Heavenly Eye: A

Heavenly Eye is said to be the power to achieve one’s goals. It’s an act of resolve to do something, then putting your entire body and soul into achieving it. One could say that it’s an act of putting your entire self and existence into your gaze, and projecting it towards your goal.
In Musashi’s case, Heavenly Eye is used only to wield her blade on the spot. For example, if she decides to cut her opponent’s right arm, she’ll do whatever it takes to sever it. Her strike will be optimized, bending time and space toward achieving this goal.
The power to narrow down all potential options for achieving a goal into a single eventuality. It could also be described as a very special type of Mystic Eye, which narrows an infinite number of possible futures down to only one.
