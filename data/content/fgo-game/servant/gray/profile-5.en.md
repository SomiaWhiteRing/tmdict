Lance that Shines to the End of the World.
Its true form is an anchor that connects the two sides of the world, and the lance that she wields is the shadow of that anchor. However, the fact that it is a shadow and that it is beyond Gray’s capabilities as a human, means that normally Add, as a Mystic Code Seal, restrains it within himself. This seal is released when necessary, and Add is able to transform into various weapons by using the power emanating from the sacred lance. Even with the thirteen restrictions and the Mystic Code Seal working in concert to limit it, the sacred lance never loses its brilliance.
