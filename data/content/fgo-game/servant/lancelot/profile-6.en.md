### Clear Interlude 「Knight of Owner」

Due to the countless honors granted to him and his own obsession with his regret, in particular the contradicting feelings of love and hate toward his king and queen, he will continue to be a prisoner to his madness.
To pacify his anguish, the black knight will continue to fight in search of the one person who can give him peace.
