### Bond 2

The union of Apollo and a human woman called Coronis led to the birth of a son. However, when a crow notified Apollo that Coronis was unfaithful (though some say the crow lied), Apollo killed her in a fit of rage. At the same time, the crowâ€™s feathers formerly white feathers were turned black. Apollo later regretted killing Coronis, and he took the child Asclepius from her womb right before she was to be cremated, and entrusts him to the centaur sage Chiron to raise.
