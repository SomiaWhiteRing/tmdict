True Medicine, The Obsolete Underworld’s Moan.
The true resurrection medication that violated the laws and realm of Hades and angered Zeus. This medicine has the power to completely revive humans and demigods, even if their bodies are completely shattered. It is said that Asclepius used this to revive Glaucus, the son of King Minos, and Hippolytus, the son of Theseus. The ingredients for this medication included Gorgon’s blood, provided by Athena via Perseus. The blood that flowed through Gorgon’s left half was said to destroy humans, while the right half had the power to save them.

But to be honest, simply extracting blood from Gorgon was not enough. When resurrecting Hippolytus, it was said to work because it also utilized Artemis’s power. As such, the resurrection medication must require highly refined divine power from the likes of Athena or Artemis to truly work. In truth, there may be even more secret ingredients necessary to produce the full effect. Ultimately, the resurrection medication of the past was not created through his medical knowledge alone, but with the help of others and no small amount of coincidental luck, and Asclepius himself has not mastered how to create the resurrection medicine all on his own.

And that’s why, obviously, he continues to pour his heart and soul in trying to replicate it.

This Noble Phantasm, as a rule, is not used in FGO.
