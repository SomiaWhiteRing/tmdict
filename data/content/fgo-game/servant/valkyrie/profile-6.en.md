### Clear Main Quest 「Go, Beyond the Twilight」

Why was Valkyrie summoned with a unique Spirit Origin? Could it be the result of all the meetings and partings that happened in the Scandinavian Lostbelt that eventually led her to bond with her Master?

It should be noted that the summoned sisters are the Heroic Spirit Servants from Proper Human History and are different from the sisters Chaldea met during the Scandinavian Lostbelt. They are completely different beings.

Only those within the Shadow Border remember the maiden warriors of the Scandinavian Lostbelt.
