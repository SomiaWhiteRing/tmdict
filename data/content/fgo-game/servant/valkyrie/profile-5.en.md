Final Illusion, Girls Advent.
The sisters have completely synchronized…
Multiple Valkyries assemble, and they fulfill their purpose of taking the souls of the fallen brave to Valhalla by raising their Noble Phantasm, Gungnir, and hurling it down upon their targets together.
While their spears inflict damage to their targets, a Bounded Field is formed within the effective area. Within this boundary, pure souls are granted mercy, while the lives of the wicked are cast aside. It is a realm that expels Servants, familiars, spells, phantasmals, bloodsucking species, and any other beings that fall under a magecraft and magical energy category. Entities that fail to resist are expelled.
