### Bond 5

The Alter Ego of yearning.
When Kiara’s SE.RA.PH evolved within the Abyssal Cyber City, she was recreated as something that accompanied SE.RA.PH.
(*Kiara deliberately extracted Meltryllis and Passionlip to use and synchronize with herself, while Kingprotea’s recreation was not something Kiara intended.)

Under normal circumstances, she would never have been found, and would have vanished like a bubble along with SE.RA.PH Kiara without ever meeting a single soul.

But since becoming a Servant, she waits for Master’s orders…or rather, she grows to love receiving orders. This is because she has no self-confidence, and so she takes joy in believing that being ordered around is the same as being loved. Protea is constantly ashamed of herself, since she is aware that she is a waste byproduct.

She has no interest in the outside world nor other humans, and simply seeks for Master’s love. Calling it an innocent advance or blind devotion sounds nice and all, but in reality, it’s a dangerous relationship, like walking a tightrope. Protea does not love Master because she has feelings for them, but simply because Master loves her, which shows that Protea only knows love without understanding true feelings of endearment and closeness. Should Master’s affection run out, she will cease to feel love, and she will quickly become unsatisfied. Should that ever happen, Protea won’t be able to endure her thirst for love, and will devour Master.

Ultimately, Protea is just like any of the other Alter Egos, born with a twisted sense of self. She will obediently follow Master’s orders, but her submission is not total. In order for that to happen, Masters who form a contract with Kingprotea will need to further develop her mental state and essence as a being. This is also necessary for Masters to be able to escape Protea’s inexhaustible, deep yearning. She will need to learn that her incessant coveting only devours and exhausts her targets, and that a healthy relationship means both parties partake of mutual love for one another.
