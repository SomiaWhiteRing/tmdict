### Bond 2

One of the Sakura Five, a cyber lifeform born from BB’s excessive and clingy emotions. As demonstrated by her massive physique, she possesses a giant Spirit Origin and terrifying ego that grows infinitely. Had she simply been left to her own devices, she would have become a cosmos-level catastrophe, so BB sealed her away in the bottom of Void Space.

The original Kingprotea was an innocent girl craving love, but when she was unleashed in the Abyssal Cyber City, SE.RA.PH, she gained a developing intellect, likely because of the person who replicated SE.RA.PH. She has the mental age of a fourteen-year-old, and is the epitome of a shy, frail girl. However, because she is hungry for love, she is aggressive even while acting innocent, and is very touchy-feely. It’s like she gives off the vibe of a shy rabbit, but in actuality she’s like a very friendly big dog.

She is not combative, but that doesn’t mean she either hates or fears battle. Should she go into battle, she won’t hesitate to annihilate her targets no matter how weak or low level the target is, and she will feel no pain in doing so. Fortunately (or unfortunately) Protea is not aware that she is a brutal goddess of destruction.
