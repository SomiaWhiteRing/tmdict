### Bond 5

#### Huge Scale: C

An id_es skill, born from her desire for growth, based on the Self-Modification skill. It enables her to scale up infinitely. When she reaches maximum level, her specs are increased to enable further level cap growth. This can be repeated infinitely, and is also called infinite growth. She is a cosmically massive catastrophe capable of destroying planets, but the larger she grows, the more she loses her intellect and complex function. Thus, her normal intellectual form would self-destruct from the inability to tolerate this skill.
This skill used to be a nonstandard rank EX, but its rank has downgraded since Chaldeaâ€™s summoning system was unable to replicate it. Growth begins the moment it is used, and the value caps that are increased are permanent until Infantile Regression is used.

#### Infantile Regression: C

The shackle BB placed upon Kingprotea. A safety device put in place to restrain her infinite growth. It returns her to her original size and stats, and resets her enlarged ego. When this skill is used, the growth from Huge Scale is reset to zero, though she gains NP corresponding with the growth stage she had reached.

#### Field Pulverization: A

When that giant Spirit Origin is used to its fullest to attack, it not only smashes the enemy unit, but the entire field is considered to be the target. Even spells cast in the spatial realm are pulverized by her punch. Really, this skill aims to resolve everything with her fists. However, as Protea gained a heart, she has sealed this skill.
