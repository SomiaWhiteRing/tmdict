The Giant Shadow That Emerges from the Sea of Life.
A Noble Phantasm that is based off the story of Samudra Manthana in Indian mythology. In the myth, it is said that the gods sought the nectar of immortality, the Amrita, in order to survive on the desolate surface land. To create the Amrita, the ocean of milk (Kshirasāgara) surrounding the world needed to be churned. The gods formed an alliance with their enemy Asuras, and began churning the ocean of milk, using Mount Mandara as the axis, and created many life-forms and elixirs. Airāvata is the name of one of the giant elephants that was created from the ocean of milk during that process.

The Kingprotea that has been summoned for a limited time in Chaldea is perpetually suppressed. This is due to the world’s repressive power, set by the limitations of the physical world, which do not exist in the cyber world.

This Noble Phantasm is a reality marble that temporarily throws off this suppression to allow Protea to revert to her true size. Protea, as a giant so large that no normal human can see her entirely, flails her arms and legs to annihilate the enemy. In the original, she herself was treated as a Noble Phantasm, but she was able to manifest her own Noble Phantasm in the cyber world in exchange for her Spirit Origin’s rank decreasing.
