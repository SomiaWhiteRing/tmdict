### Clear Interlude 「Him」

His obvious wish upon the Holy Grail would be for riches and pleasure, and he treats his Master as a partner in his unending quest for wealth.
A Master who lets him make money and makes him feel good is a good Master.
A Master who’s a stickler for morals and justice is a bad Master.
Should he ever be summoned in Chaldea, money would be the least of his worries since human history is on the verge of total annihilation, and so he would begrudgingly cooperate. Since his motivations and actions are based almost entirely on profit and losses, he understands that rebelling would be no good for him. But should there ever be an opportunity, he will try to fulfill his desires.
