### Clear Main Quest 「Flames of Progress」

#### Conquistador: EX

“Conqueror” in Spanish.
A skill given to those who conquered unknown territory through sea voyages during the Great Age of Exploration. Indicative of individuals who invaded, controlled, pillaged, and enslaved.
While the term “Conquistador” is generally used for the ones who subjugated the American continent, as the very embodiment of a conqueror from Spain, Columbus has an EX rank for this skill.
