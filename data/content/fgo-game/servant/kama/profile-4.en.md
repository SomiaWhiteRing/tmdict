### Bond 4

As a result of trauma she’s suffered, Kama prefers not to use her Noble Phantasm in service of anyone else. As she is now, Kama finds it absurd to meddle in other people’s love affairs.

Go babble about love somewhere else. Anyone looking for me to shoot arrows like Cupid should just die. It’s actually really fun to be an obstacle to anyone giddy about love and relationships…

This defiant stance exemplifies Kama’s desire to serve as a truly awful god of love.
