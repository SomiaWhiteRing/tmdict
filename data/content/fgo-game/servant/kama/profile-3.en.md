Having Affectionate Love and Withering Means To Have Not Loved Passionately.
This is in reference to the Sammohana, the flower arrow that the Kama, the god of love, possessed. It has the effect of inspiring feelings of love in whomever it strikes. When her Ananga and Mara characteristics are most prominent, the arrow of love itself becomes Kama’s lost physical body.
