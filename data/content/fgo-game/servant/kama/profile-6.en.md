### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

#### Mara Pāpīyas: EX

A temporary skill activated based on Kama’s other nature: the demon king of desire incarnate. Kama’s other name is Mara, and she is often synonymous with and considered to be the other aspect of the same being. They are at times lumped together as Kama/Mara.

The name Mara is derived from the word for “killing,” and it’s often translated as “ma (evil),” “mara (obstruction),” and “demon king.” In Buddhism, it refers to the being who lives freely among the sixth heavenly realm in the world of desire, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven.

As Buddha was trying to reach enlightenment under the bodhi tree, Mara made several attempts to distract Buddha. These efforts included Mara sending three beautiful daughters (some say they were the god himself disguised) to tempt Buddha, hurling a fiery disk, raining boulders and weapons down around Buddha, setting monsters upon Buddha, and unleashing heavy storms and rainfall. However, Buddha turned the disks and weapons into flowers, and Mara was unable to prevent Buddha from reaching enlightenment. Mara’s attempts to obstruct Buddha’s enlightenment and Kama’s interruption of Shiva’s meditation have resulted in this god being known as one with a love of tempting the faithful.

Kama/Mara can be said to be a god who embodies both the best and worst of love.
