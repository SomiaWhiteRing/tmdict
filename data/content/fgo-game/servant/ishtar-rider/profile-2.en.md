### Bond 2

Ishtar is carefree yet elegant, bold yet cruel. But since she’s dressed in modern clothes, her grandeur and terrifying divine aura have been somewhat…diminished. Her cheerfulness and generous nature have increased more than usual, and she’s now more friendly.

Mastering a bit of martial arts here and there is just the sort of thing a goddess would do… Which is, of course, utter nonsense.
The only reason Ishtar knows kung fu is because the body of the vessel she inhabits trained extensively in both magecraft and martial arts.
This time around, Ishtar fights using a smattering of the kung fu moves her vessel learned.
“Uruk Arts! That is not a thing.”
…was the comment from the King while sunbathing atop the ziggurat.
