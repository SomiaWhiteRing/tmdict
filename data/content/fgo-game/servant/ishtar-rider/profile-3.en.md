Venus’s Rainbow where the Divine Mountain Rotates around the Heavens.
As Maanna has turned into a much more modern mode of transport, its True Name has also been changed to sound modern.
A move that lets one enjoy summer with full force.
A rainbow Noble Phantasm that showers the earth after Ishtar rides her Maanna scooter around the world to visit various tourist spots and gets in a cheerful mood. Her happiness is converted to magical energy, which then gets dispersed across the land.
Her costume change is also beautiful, and the magical energy that turns into shining stars is scattered around the earth to damage enemies.
Ishtar herself is feeling both overjoyed and fabulous, but the surface world is really getting shafted.
