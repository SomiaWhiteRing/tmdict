### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Star of the Beginning, We Look Up at the Sky」

#### Primordial Sea: EX

Beast II is the sea that brings forth life itself.
Since it circulates with true ether from the time of the planet’s creation, an infinite supply of magical energy is available within it.
Anyone who is trapped within the black mud and sinks into the sea is randomly given skills such as Self-Modification, Bio-Alteration, Bio-Fusion, and Replication. When they return from the sea to the land they are forced to receive a geas from Beast II at the cellular level… a DNA contract (Amino Geas), and automatically become an enemy of humanity.

#### Nega-Genesis: A

The same type of skill as Beast VI’s Nega-Messiah.

A conceptual barrier that overturns everything modern science thinks it knows about the Theory of Evolution and the creation of the Earth. When Beast II is protected by this skill, she gains a powerful resistance to any Noble Phantasms wielded by Servants from humanity’s proper history.

#### Monstrous Strength: A++

Her ability as a monster. Increases her strength.
Close to the highest rank. With the black mud and dragon body she uses in this manifestation, Tiamat has the strength of a giant.
