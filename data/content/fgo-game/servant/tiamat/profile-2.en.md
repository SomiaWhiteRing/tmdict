### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Star of the Beginning, We Look Up at the Sky」

A womb abandoned after the creation of the world.
The “Primordial Sea” that was used as the fertile soil which created life, but when Earth’s environment settled down and ecosystems were established, she was banished to the world of void space (the world on the other side, a world of the void without life that isn’t even a parallel world).

…Since she created life at random, now that ecosystems exist, she is no longer needed. As life on this planet began the process of gaining sentience, she could only hinder things. Ever since her banishment, Tiamat waited in the world of the void for a chance to return to Earth.
