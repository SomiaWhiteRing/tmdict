### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Star of the Beginning, We Look Up at the Sky」

“Class Skills”

#### Authority of Beasts: A

Also called an “anti-humanity” skill. She gains a special attack bonus against anything born from a womb, be it Heroic or Divine Spirit. This skill is given not only to Beast II, but to all the monsters she creates as well.

#### Self-Manifestation: B

A skill that allows one to manifest in the world without outside help.
Once she manifests, she spends seven days taking over the Indian Ocean. She continues making monsters from the moment of her manifestation to devour humanity.
At the same time, Beast II herself is the sea, so she cannot come on land.
Exterminating humanity is the job of her children, the monsters.
Also, since this skill indicates that she exists across all of space-time, it can cancel out any attacks that use time travel or time paradoxes, as well as any instant death attacks.

#### Self-Modification: EX

She can use the Chaos Tide to modify her own Spirit Origin.
She can switch from her normal Spirit Origin (Femme Fatale) to a massive dragon over sixty meters tall.  In her dragon form, Tiamat nullifies any attacks below A++ rank.
