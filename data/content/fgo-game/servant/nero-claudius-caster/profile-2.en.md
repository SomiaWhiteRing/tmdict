### Bond 2

A self-proclaimed universal genius.
She was a cross-dressing beauty as a Saber (or so she says), but this time around, she is not hiding the fact that she is a beauty, and is enjoying the summer ocean wholeheartedly.
She may love herself, but she also loves the people around her. Combining narcissism and philanthropy, the fifth emperor of Rome has a truly interesting set of values.
Utilizing all her knowledge learned from the mage Simon to its fullest extent, Emperor Nero created a Mystic Code, or rather a Theatrical Code, for herself.
The pipe organs floating on either side of her body converts her beautiful voice to ATK, and gloriously shoots out lasers, fireworks, and bombs.

So how does a singing voice cause damage, you ask?
Nero still has yet to realize the cruel truth.
