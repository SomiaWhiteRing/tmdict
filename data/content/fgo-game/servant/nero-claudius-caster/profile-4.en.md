### Bond 4

#### Rampaging Privilege: EX

A skill altered from Imperial Privilege.
It is derived from the story of Olympia running amok with a chariot. It’s like a skill one learned from a former trade…a skill that promises first place, no matter what.

#### Dreams for Summer: A

Beach Flower, Nero version.
While showing off one’s own beauty, the beauty is for those who smile on the beach. However… (That was lost from the skill…)

#### Seven Crowns: C

Its scent thickens the sword and sharpens the armor.
Its method becomes vague, any disadvantages become meaningless.

#### Undying Magus: A

Magecraft learned from Simon Magus, her erstwhile mentor. Simon offered himself up for beheading, and resurrected.
