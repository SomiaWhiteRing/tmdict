### Clear Interlude 「Nightmare; or, the Call of Love and Hate」

I am the Count of Monte Cristo.
I know neither love nor compassion. Until I burn everything to cinders, I will remain an Avenger, fueled by hatred and vengeance to make myself a brightly burning black flame of rage.
My beloved Haydée does not exist in this world, and thus, I will be a vengeful demon for eternity…
