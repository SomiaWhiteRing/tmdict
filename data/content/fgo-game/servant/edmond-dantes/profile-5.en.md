The manifestation of his iron will, trained within the hellish Château d’If. He can escape not only the prison of his body, but also the formless prisons of time and space.
By accelerating his thought processes and forcing his body to reflect them, he can move at incredibly high speeds.
To those observing his movements, it might look like he has the ability to stop time.

In this game, his high-speed movements enable him to create clones and attack multiple times simultaneously.
