### Bond 3

“I don’t mind making enemies.
But I couldn’t stand the fact that the one man I wanted but could never have, stood with the men of Ulster.
I talked to him. I invited him. And not only did he not accept me, he gave me this look like, ‘What are you doing?’”
“I’ll make him pay. I’ll make him pay! I’ll make him pay! I’ll make him pay! That man…”
“Cú Chulainn of Ulster! I swear by my name as Medb, the ruler and lover of all men, I will make you succumb to me!”
