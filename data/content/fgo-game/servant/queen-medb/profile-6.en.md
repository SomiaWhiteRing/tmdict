### Clear Interlude 「Queen’s Discipline」

Sure, her obsession with the Ulster hero named Cú Chulainn still remains to this day, but her wish for the Grail has nothing to do with him.
She wants “To make all the wonderful men, past, present, and future, into my lovers.”
Preferably ones who are agreeable, not jealous, and fearless.
If her Master is a hero worthy in her eyes, she’ll give them all of her love with everything she has to offer, regardless of who else might be watching.
Just like the whip in her hands, her love is violent and merciless.
