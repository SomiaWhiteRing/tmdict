Five Soldiers of the War God, Fake.
Red Hare does not possess the Heroic Spirit Lu Bu’s Noble Phantasm’s Heaven Scorcher Halberd, God Force. What is fired instead is a version of God Force…or at least a giant shot heavily inspired by it. It may not be a massive beam of magical energy, but the heavy bow does fire a giant spear.

It likely ended up so during Red Hare’s search for a large and powerful arrow, where he ultimately came to the conclusion that he all he really needed was a spear to get the job done.
