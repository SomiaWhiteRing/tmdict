### Clear Singularity 4 Main Quest 「Beyond the Fog」

#### Revelation: B

The power to hear the voice of God and take the most appropriate action.
Intuition is a sixth sense during combat, but Revelation applies to all things related to achieving one’s goal (For example, picking which road to travel on a journey.)
Solomon received Revelation only once, but he was able to use it to establish the field of phenomena control, magecraft, despite being a normal man.
(Until then, magecraft was the domain of those related to the gods.)
