### Clear Singularity 4 Main Quest 「Beyond the Fog」

#### 『Ars Almadel Salomonis』

The third Noble Phantasm of King Solomon.
The First of the Original Sins.
It may appear to be a circle of light surrounding the Earth.
However its true form is an aggregation of millions of rays of light.
Each ray possesses the massive damage capability of Excalibur, an A-rank Noble Phantasm.
Unfortunately, nothing on Earth surpasses the heat output of this Noble Phantasm.
