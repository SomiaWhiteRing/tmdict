### Bond 3

Hektor was the strongest Trojan warrior, the leader of their armies, and a politician as well. He was so talented that even the gods could not guess his actions, and he temporarily succeeded in almost driving the Achaeans away.
His Noble Phantasm is Durindana, the unbreakable spear.
Hektor liked to extend the handle of his blade and use it as a spear.
Itâ€™s said that this spear could pierce anything in the world.
Later the weapon would lose its function as a spear, and be known as the legendary sword, Durendal.
