The Revolving Sword of Victory.
The sword of the sun that has an artificial sun stored in its hilt.
Similar to the king’s sacred sword Excalibur, this sister sword was also brought by the fairy “Lady of the Lake.”
While the king and her sword receive the divine protection of the moon, Gawain and this sword receive the grace of the sun.
