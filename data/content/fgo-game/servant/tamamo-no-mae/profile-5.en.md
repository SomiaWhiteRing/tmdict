### Bond 5

#### Fox’s Wedding: EX

Tamamo’s own version of the skill Item Construction.
By one-sidedly announcing her marriage, she can cause a rain of blessings to fall, and any friendly-ish targets will be forced to give her presents to celebrate.
An OP skill matching her personality!
Cut that out, Amaterasu!
