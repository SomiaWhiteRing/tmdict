### Bond 2

It all happened at the end of the seventeenth century…
Witch trials took place in the Puritan village of Salem.
A young girl named Abigail Williams was one of the first to show signs of demonic possession.
The unusual symptoms soon spread to the other girls, and many villagers were accused of witchcraft over the course of the next year.
In the end, two hundred people were arrested. Nineteen of them were hanged, two died while imprisoned, and one died under torture.
The girls’ true intentions and what may have triggered their symptoms are still shrouded in mystery.
