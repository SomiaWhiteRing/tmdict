### Clear Interlude 「A Dream of a Thousand Stars and One Hundred Nights」

The outer god, “All-in-One and One-in-All.”
While it may have only been a fabrication of a brilliant man, it was still powerful enough to establish itself as a force of endless madness. Those…things may never have truly existed historically, but they could not abandon at least the potential to become observers from a distant abyss. And so, she was given the class of a visitor from the void: Foreigner.

The Demon God Pillar Räum, in an attempt to make the impossible possible, pursued the source of the man’s idea, traced the historical incident that inspired the idea, and was ultimately led to a girl who was essential to this plan.
And so Abigail is a kind of priestess who serves the outer god, a vessel that enables it to manifest, and a key that opens up the gate to the abyss of falsity.
