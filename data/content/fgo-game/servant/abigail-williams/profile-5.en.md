### Bond 5

As a Puritan, Abigail was an innocent girl who loved God and never forgot to pray and give thanks for her blessings. She was just a sensitive girl of a tender age who never once thought to be suspicious of others.

The Puritans placed value on earthly hardships, and they crossed the Atlantic ocean to flee the oppression of the power hungry church, and ended up in the New World. However, others eventually caught up to and cornered them. Their “protest” was soon directed to their neighbors and those nearby.

In answer to what they saw as the moral decay of the world around them, the Puritans embraced the steadfast belief that one must restrain oneself, which became their way of monitoring one another. The difficult colonial life rife with war and pillaging soon created a mentality of suspicion and selfishness.
Hysteria gripped the people, and they sought to lay the blame at witches’ feet. They began to believe that their misfortunate was the work of the devil himself.

The gates of the atrocious witch trials soon opened with the emergence of witches in Salem. This tumultuous situation became the keyhole while the girl became the key that reflected the sentiments of the people. If both sides are fundamentally necessary for the other to exist, which side is truly to blame?
