### Bond 4

#### Tactician’s Advice: B++

The reason for the “++” is that he was able to make Lu Bu obey him.
This may mean that Chen Gong can advise his liege lord in a greater capacity than even Zhuge Liang.

#### Tactician’s Cherished Desire: A

Chen Gong charges through the battlefield with the treacherous hero Lu Bu. Chen Gong may be relentless and calculating, but even he possesses the conviction and passion of a warrior.
He soulfully vows to die for and alongside his lord. In other words, a tactician’s cherished desire.
This is a limited Hero Creation skill that can be used only on Berserker-Class Servants.
