### Bond 5

His wish upon the Holy Grail is a complex one. There is a part of him, a resigned lifetime ambition, that wants to govern a nation and create his notion of an ideal society. At the same time, there is another side of him that wants to serve who he considers the ideal lord until the very end.

Chen Gong may have an aggressive personality, but he is a realist, and as a person who hates unnecessary work, modern society turned out to be the answer. “Ah, so society turned out this way. That’s fine. If less than half of the population is dying unnecessarily, I’d call that a win.”

Thus, since becoming a Servant, Chen Gong’s desire as a tactician has been prioritized, and he holds high expectations for his Master and employer.
His hope is that Master is able to breathe life into the plans he abandoned in the past.
