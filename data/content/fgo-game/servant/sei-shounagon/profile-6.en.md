### Bond 5

Under normal circumstances, Sei Shounagon would not have been registered into the Throne of Heroes as a Servant.

When she completed writing “The Pillow Book,” she gracefully departed court life. Discarding both love and resentment of her previous lifestyle, she continued to live the rest of her life carrying the one hopeful star within her heart as she looked back at her incredible past life. Closing that door also meant that her star’s light went out, and she did not have the means of becoming a guardian of humanity.

However, due to an irregular summoning caused by a certain incident, Sei Shounagon was given another chance. Through the many connections she formed with the people she trusted and the many things she experienced, the long-dormant poet within her awoke, creating new possibilities within her that ultimately resulted in her being inscribed upon the Throne of Heroes. And so it became possible to summon her.

Even should they never have experienced those wild times with her, Sei Shounagon surely anticipates the day she can finally reunite with them.
