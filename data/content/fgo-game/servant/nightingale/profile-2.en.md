### Bond 2

Born to a wealthy member of the gentry, she was popular in the social world. However, at a young age she decided to work as a nurse, which was considered a lowly profession.
After gaining skills and knowledge in the fields of nursing and medicine, she directed a reform in the field of nursing from a clinic at Harley Street, London. She used her personal fortune to create modern facilities and improve conditions for nurses.
At the request of Wartime Minister Sidney Herbert, an acquaintance, she went to the site of the Crimean war as the director of a group of British army nurses.

What she found there was hell.
