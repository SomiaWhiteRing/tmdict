### Bond 4

#### Haphazard Planning: D+

While it was a completely reckless plan, luck was on her side.
Rises to rank B due to the Angel of Assassination.

#### Angel of Assassination: A

The name given to her by the people due to her lovely appearance and her bold plan.
Riding on her luck, lowers the guard of her enemies.

#### Iron Determination: D

A skill that comes from her firm resolve to carry through with the assassination, despite being far detached from the world of assassination or revolution.
Not as intense as Dantès’s.
