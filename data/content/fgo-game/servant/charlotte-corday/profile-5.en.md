Love for My Country, Give Them a Dream They Can Drown In.
A silent and warm assassination by Charlotte Corday, who was dubbed the “Angel of Assassination”.
Until the moment they are killed, the target feels no threat or indication of murderous intent. Unlike other assassination Noble Phantasms, evasion through Intuition or Mind’s Eye is difficult.
The more times the target is aware of her appearance, her words, and her mannerisms, the assassination success rate goes up.
The bias that a lovely woman like her would never kill anyone intensifies.
