### Bond 4

#### Armor of Nine Worthies: A

A skill that sublimated from the legend of Mandricardo wearing Hektor’s armor. The numerous epic tales that revolve around Hektor reinforce Mandricardo’s body, and the armor’s overwhelming legendary power manifests as artificial Charisma.

#### Brigliadoro’s Neigh: A

A skill that sublimated from the legend of Mandricardo stealing and breaking in the famed steed. Mobility, ATK, and reputation rise. But in return, he becomes an even more appealing target for his enemies. Additionally, this skill will enable him to steal and ride any mount, even Demonic Beasts, as long as they are C rank or lower.
