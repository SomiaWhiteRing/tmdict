### Bond 3

In life, he was quite pompous, believing himself to be superior to all. However, his inability to defeat Bradamante’s lover, Ruggiero, even while wearing Hektor’s own armor and wielding Durendal, shattered his confidence.

At the very least, he becomes confident during battle, just to hype himself up.
