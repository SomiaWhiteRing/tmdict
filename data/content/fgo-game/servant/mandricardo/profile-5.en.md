Oath To Never Bear a Sword.
This Noble Phantasm arises from the legend of Mandricardo swearing never to carry a sword until he lays claim to Durendal. In effect, his Noble Phantasm causes any weapon he wields to possess the power of Durendal itself. It is quite similar to Lancelot’s Noble Phantasm Knight of Owner, but its more powerful because it has the same power as Durendal, and it handles exactly like Durendal no matter what weapon he uses. However, because it only copies Durendal’s strength, its durability corresponds to the rank of the weapon he holds (which is usually E rank).
