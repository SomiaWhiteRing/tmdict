### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: The Snowy Ruins and the Girl Knight」

Bradamante, as a Servant, is best described as someone continually pursuing a shining dream, given her devotion to Ruggiero. So long as she embodies her story, Ruggiero will continue to be the hope she tirelessly seeks. She may never reach a happy ending as she did in her life, but it is her eternal pursuit that defines her as a Heroic Spirit.

“Of course I’m a little sad! But before I get all mopey, I’m a holy knight first and foremost, so I will do my very best to try to reclaim the world!”

“That’s the spirit. Oh by the way, I’m speaking directly into your mind.”

“Oh, Lord Merlin!”
