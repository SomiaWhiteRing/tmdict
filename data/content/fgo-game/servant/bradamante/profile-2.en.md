### Bond 2

After many adventures, Bradamante eventually fell in love with Ruggiero, a general of her enemyâ€™s army. In order to be with the man she loves, Bradamante had to overcome many hardships.

Whether her love is abducted by an evil mage, imprisoned by an evil witch, or even if a prince of Greece seeks her hand in marriage, Bradamante never abandoned her love, and ever sought to be with him.

She is a knight strong both in heart and body, and will never give up. In pursuit of her dream, she is doggedly relentless, never giving up in the face even of repeated failure or misfortune. She is truly a virtuous female knight who, when faced with a dilemma, remains steadfast in her belief in justice and doing right.
