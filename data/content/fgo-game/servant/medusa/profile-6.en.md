### Clear Interlude 「Gorgon’s Bride」

Out of the three Gorgon sisters, she’s the only one who ended up “growing.”
She went from a goddess loved by all, to a goddess who wanted to save (rule) over all.
Corrupted by her growing hatred towards humans, she ended up becoming a demonic beast who devoured heroes.
The name “Gorgon” was given to the goddess for what she became.
