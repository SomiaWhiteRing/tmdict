### Bond 4

#### Supreme Mystic Code, Volumen Hydrargyrum: B

One of the supreme Mystic Codes from the El-Melloi family of the Clock Tower’s twelve houses. Expandable and elastic, it can transform into a powerful sword or impregnable armor capable of reinforcing its wearer’s abilities. It can even turn into a maid composed of mercury if necessary. This ability originates from Reines, not Sima Yi. Her precise command of Volumen Hydrargyrum is said to exceed even her predecessor’s. It is thanks to this Code that her STR is boosted up to B Rank.
