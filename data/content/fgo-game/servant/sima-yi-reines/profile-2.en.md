### Bond 2

The girl who acts as the vessel, Reines, is the original Lord of the El-Melloi family, one of the twelve families that operate the Mage’s Association.

Under normal circumstances, she would have succeeded the previous holder of the Lord title. However, considering her age and the ensuing power struggle…as well as for Reines’s own personal amusement, she transferred her position to Lord El-Melloi II. She has since taken to playing the mastermind in the background.

Upon becoming a Pseudo-Servant, Sima Yi left all operations in the modern world to the vessel, much like Zhuge Liang. However, unlike Zhuge Liang, who is more open-minded and rational, Sima Yi often rises to the surface.
