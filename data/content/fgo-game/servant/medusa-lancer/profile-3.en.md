Embrace of the Goddess.
The ability that the original Medusa (Rider) has as a skill. In other words, the ability that the current Medusa will possibly gain in the future is manifested as a Noble Phantasm.
After a strike with her immortal-killing blade, she gazes upon her opponent, instantly petrifying them. This “Cybele” is on the most powerful level of Mystic Eyes.
Her powerful attacks are centered around this technique.
