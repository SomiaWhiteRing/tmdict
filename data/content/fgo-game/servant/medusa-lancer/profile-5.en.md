### Bond 5

#### Monstrous Strength: C

Temporarily enhances strength. A special type of attack possessed only by monsters and magical beasts. By using it, Strength increases by one rank. The duration of its effect depends on the skill’s rank.
…Since her monstrous side is quite weak, it has a low rank.

#### Distant Thoughts: A

A horizon that may have existed once in the past…
Her memories of those wonderful days will keep her fighting until the end.
