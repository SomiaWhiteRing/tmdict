My Lovely’s Caladbolg.
She uses the Noble Phantasm and demonic sword Caladbolg of the hero Fergus, who was one of her lovers during her lifetime.
Obviously, revealing its True Name is also possible, but it appears she’s refraining from doing so this time around. Even Queen Medb wouldn’t cause an earthquake at a wonderful resort…or rather, THE Queen Medb would never do something like that.

Whether she is able to make use of this Noble Phantasm because of her ability to make any hero hers like her Rider self, or whether she simply borrowed it from Fergus in Chaldea…we may never know. As might be expected, it is not as strong as when Fergus wields it, but it has gained something in flexibility and versatility. The moment she wields it, making it seem so fashionable and cute, and cries “hi-ya,” a rainbow veil stretches across the field. Any enemy Medb targets is entangled in the enchanting light, and will be neutralized without really understanding what’s happening.

In this game, she keeps it equipped by default. Its True Name will not be revealed.
