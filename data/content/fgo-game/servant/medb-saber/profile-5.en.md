A Lovely Summer’s Amorous Rendezvous.
Summer love, and a single photograph (one shot) taken as a memento.
The original Medb is a Rider who has the special ability to control Noble Phantasms of the heroes whom she called her own during her lifetime. But with her Spirit Origin changed in consequence of her donning a swimsuit, Medb gained a new Noble Phantasm. Put differently, this is Medb’s deadly Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm that taps into one of her greatest weapons: her Charm ability. The moment Medb greets the target, even saying something as simple as, “Oh, hello,” during her stroll while she hums, the target is immediately enamored with her and experiences summer love. They will inevitably fall in love. And after Medb has used the target to her content, there is nothing left for them to do but perish in the summer skies…
