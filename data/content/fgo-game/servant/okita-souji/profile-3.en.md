### Bond 3

#### Mumyou Sandanzuki

Anti-Personnel Mystic Sword.
Captures a maximum of 1 target.
A three-stage thrust.
An ultimate technique used by the prodigy, Okita Souji. Consists of the “First Thrust,” the “Second Thrust,” and the “Third Thrust.”
The three thrusts are not almost simultaneous, but completely simultaneous. A secret technique only usable by the truly skilled and agile.
