### Clear 「Final Act: Up in Flames!! GUDAGUDA Honnoji」

Her wish upon the Grail is “to fight until the end.”
This was her dearest wish, and one she ended her life unable to fulfill.
Even now as a Heroic Spirit, she regrets being unable to fight with her former comrades, and is convinced that she’s a failure as a member of the Shinsengumi.
