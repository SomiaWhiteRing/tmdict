The Beast of Crunching Deathtusk.
In his rage Cú Chulainn temporarily embodies the exoskeleton of the Curruid, a sea monster whose body was used to create the Gáe Bolg, and wears it like an armor.
An offensive-type bone armor. By wearing it, he increases his endurance and his strength parameter becomes EX.
He cannot use Gáe Bolg while activating this Noble Phantasm.
