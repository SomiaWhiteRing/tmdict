### Bond 4

#### Dragon Witch: EX

She was created by a certain man’s wish, and has the power to command over dragons. Perhaps this is the inverse result of the legends of dragon-slaying saints like Saint Martha and Saint Georgios.
She possesses a special kind of Charisma, one that can make dragons obey and increase overall party’s ATK.
