### Clear Main Quest 「Melody Just for You」

Torture by impalement? The story of the Iron Maiden?
She claimed those have nothing to do with her, and changed her weapon from a spear to a fork.
Since she has an abundance of magical energy, she can use spells and Magecraft without learning them first.
However, she doesn’t seem to understand how that’s possible.
She’s full of potential and talent, but she doesn’t know how to harness them.
That, too, is very much like her.
