### Bond 2

Halloween was originally a Celtic harvest festival that had nothing to do with theme parks, but these facts have nothing to do with Elisabeth.
She celebrates because it’s very romantic, she shoots fireworks because it’s very dramatic, and she makes pumpkin pies (DON’T EAT THEM) because she’s sure you’ll love them.
