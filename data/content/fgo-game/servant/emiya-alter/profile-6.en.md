### Clear 「Lost Bullet」

Truth be told, this man became what he was because of a dreadful trauma he experienced and a task that he imposed upon himself. That task: saving innocent citizens.

As the man became an Alter, though, he lost sight of his cause. He even lost sight of his original vision, and soon only the results mattered to him. In the end, he lost everything.

With his long period of atonement ended, the man stands atop the gallows and finally sees what he has wished for since his childhood: justice for the masses.
