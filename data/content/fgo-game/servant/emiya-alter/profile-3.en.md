### Bond 3

#### Icy Sneer: A

A skill similar to Mental Corruption, bestowed upon him during his inversion.
However, unlike Mental Corruption, this skill forces a fixed concept onto its bearer, with an effect akin to brainwashing.
This concept causes the victim to prioritize the protection of humanity above all else, creating a perfect sacrificial guardian.
Without the A rank, he would be unable to make full use of his power in his inverted state.
