Afterglow, Fortress of Cursed Blood.
A reproduction of the multiple fortresses (called Kremlin, or Kreml’) that have been built throughout Russia. Anastasia, by her right as a descendant of the Romanov Dynasty, summons a splendid, impregnable fortress to protect herself.

Only those whom Anastasia selects may enter this castle. Any others will be seen as invaders, and the fortress will attack them.
This Noble Phantasm is, as a rule, not used in FGO.
