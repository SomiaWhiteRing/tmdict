### Bond 3

#### Schwipsig: B

Meaning “little devil,” this is simultaneously one of Anastasia’s nicknames and one of Viy’s skills.

It is with this that little impossibilities, small acts of mischief, are made possible, whether it be creating small cracks in the ground to trip someone up, or snatching objects out of people’s hands and having them fly into your own.

While this skill seems outrageous, its effective range is small and it cannot inflict serious or fatal harm.
