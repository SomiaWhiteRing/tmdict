### Bond 5

A gentle, passive girl in her late teens.
She is the epitome of a reserved woman who would treat her husband with respect. She does not like violent men, but at the same time, she thinks they’re cute because their behavior is childish.
That is why, when faced with a perfectly reasonable, reasoning person, she feels admiration (yearning) rather than fondness.

She values social mores and is generally polite. However, she is a realist and even a pessimist at heart, and so sometimes makes cutting remarks. She is patient, but the moment something goes awry, she will not stop until she gets a hold of the other person (to solve whatever issue)…like a runaway dump truck.
In that sense, she is like Shiki, who never hesitates in her decisions or actions.

While her personality, actions, and way of speaking are feminine, her hobbies are far from girly. She enjoys watching horror movies and any other morbid activity done alone.
She may not realize this until the very end, but she is a latent sadist. This is the reason why she becomes cruel, merciless, and uncouth the moment she is cornered.
