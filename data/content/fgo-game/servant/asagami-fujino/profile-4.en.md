Nostalgia that descends like summer rain.
A sense of perception beyond human, a result from a complication of Clairvoyance…
It is a super long-distance destructor that visualizes the target from above, a god’s-eye view, and twists the target to destroy it.

The pain that’s been sealed opens up and spirals like a screw.
…Its breakdown is like a woman collapsing in sadness.
