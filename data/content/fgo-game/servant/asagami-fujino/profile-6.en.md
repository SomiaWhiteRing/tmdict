### Bond 5

Fujino’s time period was destroyed in consequence of the Incineration of Humanity.
She herself was burned along with her time, but the Counter Force did not overlook her exceptional powers.
Arayashiki acknowledged her special ability as a force that could help reverse the Incineration of Humanity, and she was  summoned as a temporary Servant in Chaldea.
She considers her current existence to be simply a dream.
Just like Shiki, she is like an illusion that lasts only a single night…a being that will disappear if the Incineration of Humanity is not reversed.
An individual with normal sensibilities would confused and panic, but Fujino accepted this bizarre situation without protest.
She acknowledges and understand her position as one who was called forth as a Servant, and she is sure to do her best to help her Master.
