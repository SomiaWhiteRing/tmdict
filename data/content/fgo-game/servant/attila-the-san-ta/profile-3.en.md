### Bond 3

Her personality hasn’t changed much, but since she’s a tad feverish, her judgment is maybe a little compromised and she’s slightly more gullible than before. She also seems to be…cuter.

Normal Altera’s personality is 90% soldier, and 10% child, but Santa Altera’s personality is 40% soldier and 60% child.

She’s convinced herself that she must be Santa Claus first, and Altera second, so she is gentler than usual.
To deliver the “important present” entrusted to her by the shining sheep, she relies on Master.
