Rainbow of the Holy Night, Sword of the War God.
A new Noble Phantasm that was created when Altera’s Sword of the War God changed into a candy cane.
Photon Ray can also be called Photon Ram.
Enjoy the beautiful, eternal circus of sheep under Altera’s command.
This is actually a secret attempt on her part to compete with the Caster of Okeanos’s piggy march Noble Phantasm, but we don’t really have time to get into that right now.

Far away from the stone tomb…
No memories or records connect.
The great isolation she feels may still not be gone…
But the dreaming sheep streaks across the night sky like a rainbow.
