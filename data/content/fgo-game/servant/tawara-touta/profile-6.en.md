### Clear Interlude 「Slaying the Great Centipede」

Tawara Touta is an open-minded, food-loving Servant. Normally, his bulging muscles and overbearing personality would drive people away, but his open, honest smile makes him very approachable.
It’s better to share a meal with others rather than eat alone.
He’s a good Servant to emulate in terms of lifestyle and habits!
He can’t eat lasers, but his rice is delicious!
