### Clear Interlude 「Overflowing Wildness」

As a prideful wild beast, once she serves a “Master,” she will be loyal until the end.
After entering a contract Tamamo Cat will become a loyal guardian who only wishes for her Master’s wellbeing.
Her top priority becomes protecting her Master and her Master’s happiness, to the point that she no longer thinks about her own happiness.
