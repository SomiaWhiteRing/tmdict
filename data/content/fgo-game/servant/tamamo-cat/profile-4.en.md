### Bond 4

#### Morph: B

She creates a temporary body. It is the same spell used by the Millennial Fox of China (whom many believe is the same person as Tamamo) to possess Daji in the “Investiture of the Gods.”
Due to past trauma, Tamamo-no-Mae has restricted herself from using this spell. But Tamamo Cat does not have self-control. She only knows chaos.
