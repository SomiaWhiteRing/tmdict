### Bond 4

In the Year 59 (some say 60), to pay homage to the Olympics held in Greece, she started the “Nero Fest,” to be held once every five years.
The competition held three divisions of music, horse-riding, gymnastics, and she participated in a number of those.
In the Year 69, she was dethroned by the rebellion and fled from Rome.
During her escape, she realized she couldn’t get away and decided to end her life.
