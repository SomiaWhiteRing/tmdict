### Clear Interlude 「LEGEND-OF-THE-SAMURAI」

Sasaki Kojirou, unlike Musashi, is an imaginary swordsman whose real life events were never completely proven.
This “Sasaki Kojirou” is merely a nameless swordsman, called forth to fill the role of the legendary swordsman because he could recreate the skill of the “Swallow Reversal.”
His purpose for materialization was to fill in for a imaginary figure, yet what went through the mind of this nameless prodigy is…
“Well, I guess this is fine.”
