### Bond 2

A virtuous Heroic Spirit who is both loyal and cordial. More or less the same person as his Lancer self, his Saber self nonetheless more knightly. Whether consciously or not, he also tends more toward self-affirmations.

His Spirit Origin and performance have both improved over his Lancer iteration, but this has also made him more difficult to summon. This Spirit Origin cannot manifest until certain conditions are met, regardless of how skilled the summoner may be, and the opportunity to do so may fade away like so much mist.
