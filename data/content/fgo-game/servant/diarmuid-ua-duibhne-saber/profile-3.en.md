### Bond 3

#### Mana Burst (Jump): A

As Diarmuid was raised by the gods, he gained a superhuman ability to leap great heights and distances. In consequence of this, his agility is lower than when he is summoned as a Lancer. This Mana Burst allows him to increase his mobility in short, explosive bursts while also increasing his overall offensive ability.

#### The Knights of Fianna’s Honor: B

Diarmuid’s extraordinary resolve. His knightly gallantry made manifest.
