### Clear Interlude 「Arrival of Twin Swords」

According to legend, whenever Diarmuid went on a life-or-death adventure, he took the demonic blade Móralltach and demonic spear Gáe Dearg. For any less dangerous expeditions, he instead brought the demonic blade Beagalltach and demonic spear Gáe Buidhe.

When Diarmuid died, he was wielding the latter set of weapons.

Had he ventured into the mountains with his more powerful weapons, the demon boar would have been defeated, and the strongest of the Knights of Fianna may have lived a longer life.
