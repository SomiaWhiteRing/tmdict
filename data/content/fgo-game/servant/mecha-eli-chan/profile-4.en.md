### Bond 4

#### Innocent Kaiju: EX

An id_es skill altered from its base, “Innocent Monster.”
As an iron dragon girl, Mecha Eli-chan uses the power of movie-making special effects to fly through the air, breathe fire, shoot electricity, and fire missiles.
Her capabilities are truly befitting a guardian god of iron.  The user of this skill secretly wishes a theme song would play when she employs it.

#### Overload Type II: C

A skill based on one that Frankenstein and Babbage possess that has been altered.
While the Noble Phantasm is not strengthened, HP is sacrificed to increase the NP gauge. According to an Elisa research expert identified only by the initial R:
“This is just the beginning of a self-destruct thing, right!?”

#### One Hundred Consecutive Shots of Magus: EX

A terrifyingly wicked “party” that unleashes the Mecha Eli-chans from the mass production line to attack an enemy.
And at the end, one hundred Mecha Eli-chans combine to turn into a giant spear, and terrible…terrible things happen to the enemy.
In a different world, this is called “Superhuman Sister’s Alliance.”
Not utilized in FGO.
