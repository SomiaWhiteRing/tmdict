### Clear Main Quest 「Section 15: Final Explosion Coaster」

Mecha Eli-chan (correctly) acknowledges that she is a golem (mecha).
Just like Passionlip and Meltryllis, she respects Elisabeth Báthory as the original after whom she is patterned, but she also hates her at the same time.
Mecha Eli-chan attempted to berate Elisabeth and drive her away when she said, “I’m a much better noblewoman than you.” She did not actually desire to kill Elisabeth though.
She would have no reason to reject Elisabeth if she became an ideal noble, but since Elisabeth is a Servant that is only capable of being the innocent monster she is, Mecha Eli-chan knows such a day will never come.
Carmilla is no good for the same reason.
Carmilla has the personality and temperament of an ideal noblewoman, but the lifestyle she lives as a vampire is a disqualifying offense.

Initially, she saw Master as an evil person who had sided with her enemy (Elisabeth) who came to destroy Himeji Castle, but the misunderstanding was soon cleared up after she fought alongside Master.
To Mecha Eli-chan, Master, who tried to protect Castle Csejte even though they came from another country, became “a trusted pilot candidate dedicated to justice in spite of being a lowly commoner.”
