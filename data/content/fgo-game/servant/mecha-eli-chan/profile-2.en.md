### Bond 2

A Servant of justice (who lacks adaptability).
It’s no coincidence that her alignment is Lawful-Good, the complete opposite of Elisabeth Báthory.
Cool-headed and thoughtful…she is a true lady.
She seldom raises her voice, but whenever she encounters evil, she switches gears to become a self-righteous governess, and lets loose with a truly scathing scolding.
Had Elisabeth not become obsessed with blood…or if someone had shielded her from the pressures of the notion that women have no value unless they are beautiful…the history of Castle Csejte might have been different.
This Alter Ego is the embodiment of one of countless “what ifs.”
