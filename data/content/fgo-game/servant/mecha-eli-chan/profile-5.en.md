### Bond 5

Mecha Eli-chan may possess perfect beauty, but she is not without her flaws. One of them is the standards she sets regarding what constitutes justice. Since she is the castle’s guardian, anyone who defies her or her rules is evil in her eyes*, and she attacks them! 

*Because her digital brain takes a good deal of time to process the contradictions of humans, she worries that she may be punishing people who haven’t done things that are truly evil…but she doesn’t actually voice that particular concern.

Even traitors and criminals have their reasons. There is always room for extenuating circumstances…or, at least the intellectual part of Mecha Eli-chan thinks that. And so, she agonizes over her self-righteous way of thinking, and she knows she really needs to improve in that respect.
She really is just a good girl.
