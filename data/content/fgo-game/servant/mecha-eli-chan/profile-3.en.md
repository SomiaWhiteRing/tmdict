Steel Sky Demoness.
Mecha Eli-chan directs her full complement of artillery at a single person in the ultimate private concert. Normally, this is an Anti-Army NP, and it’s honestly a bit ridiculous that it’s all getting used on one person.

The final Blast Voice may look like a beam attack, but it’s just noise. It’s an aftereffect of the Dragon Lung within her being unleashed at its full potential.
Through dimensional compression, the Lung possesses reverberation space the size of a football stadium, and it can create a sonic wave of destruction as intense as Elisabeth Báthory’s, without even using Castle Csejte as an amp.
