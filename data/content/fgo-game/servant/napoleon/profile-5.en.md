An Arc of a Rainbow that Announces a Triumphant Return.
An artillery Noble Phantasm that shares the same name as the French triumphal arch.
The possibilities inherent in humanity (apex primates) are transformed into a cannon shell, which streaks through the sky like a rainbow when fired.
Using the Heroic Spirit Napoleon’s very being as its base and adding in the legend that he bombarded the Sphinx of Giza, it has become a Noble Phantasm.
Its outward appearance is a one-handed, reconfigurable cannon. Based on the legend of him destroying the Sphinx, this attack is particularly effective against Divinity.
