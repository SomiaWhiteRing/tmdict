Kenran makai nichirin jyou.
What remains of the “Fortress of the Sun,” the representation of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the child of the sun. The burning Osaka Castle appears, and the ghosts of Toyotomi followers emerge from the ground and attack the enemy, while the surrounding area is engulfed in bright red flames.
In the end, everything is incinerated and she herself bursts into flames. A manifestation of destruction… The remnants of the fallen sun.
A Noble Phantasm that embodies Chacha’s final moments as the woman who destroyed Toyotomi, the cursed courtesan beauty, and the princess of a fiery hell.
