Obey Me, I Am the God of Obstacles.
This is used only under special circumstances.
The name Ganesha means “Lord of the Masses,” and Vighneśvara is Ganesha’s other name, which means “Lord of Obstacles.”

Purifying the characteristics as the god who removes obstacles manifests this Noble Phantasm that creates an impenetrable territory. Use it offensively, and its absolute strength would take out or push aside any obstacles in the way. And obviously, if it’s used defensively, it can be a perfect shield that prevents any kind of obstacle caused by an attack from penetrating the barrier it creates.

In the Indian Lostbelt, she uses this Noble Phantasm, combined with Lakshmi’s Noble Phantasm and its similar characteristics, to completely enclose her surroundings to create a shut-in’s room that’s absolutely impenetrable, unreachable even by the god who has the power to recreate the world.
