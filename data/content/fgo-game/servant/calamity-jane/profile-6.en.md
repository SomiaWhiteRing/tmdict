O Polar Star, Illuminate My Enemy.
Jane’s second Noble Phantasm.
One of the Noble Phantasms called the “Four Cards” used by the squadron that beat the primordial goddess.
The enemy’s weakness is detected, and its state gets fixed as the “truth.”
By defeating the primordial goddess, Jane was inflicted with a curse, causing her to no longer be able to utilize this Noble Phantasm.

In the Servant Universe 2000 years ago, Jane joined the team that took on the primordial goddess, serving as their scout. While the mission was a success thanks to the accurate intel she gathered, she received a curse of immortality after killing the goddess, causing her to no longer be capable of dying until the goddess reawakened.
A typical person would be driven mad by such endless wandering, but Jane’s innate cheerfulness has enabled her to endure the curse.
