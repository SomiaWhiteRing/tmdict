Sword of Promised Victory.
The shining sacred sword that saves the planet.
Created to vanquish external threats with the power to destroy the planet, it is a golden blade that repels every form of evil.

Out of the 13 seals placed on the sacred sword, six have been released in its current form.
Even with the remaining seven seals locked, restraining in its true power, its intense light can still annihilate even the greatest of evils.

In this game, the release of the “Seal of Bedivere” is automatically approved, given the reality that decisive battles against great enemies can be expected.
