### Bond 3

#### Grace of the King of Gods: A+

Europa was deeply loved by the highest being in Greek mythology: Zeus. As such, this skill provides numerous protections. It does risk invoking the wrath of Zeus’s wife Hera, but Europa herself doesn’t seem to mind, since in her eyes, Hera is a great goddess who should be revered and respected.

#### The King of Gods’ White Bull: C

The white bull that Europa encountered—which was Zeus taking the guise of the bull—was a Divine Beast that possessed strong Charm, and it is the bull that was later made into the constellation Taurus. It is said to captivate anyone who lays eyes on it. This skill derives from the bull Europa rode, rather than from the goddess herself.
