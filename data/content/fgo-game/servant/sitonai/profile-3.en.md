### Bond 3

#### Snow Fairy: EX

The evolved form of the skill “Child of Nature.”
So long as the user believes her target must be attacked, even loved ones are not safe from this icy cold. This ability freezes all nearby targets.

#### Frozen Emotion: B

Chilled empathy. Indifference.
The mindset of an innocent, smiling girl who is capable of turning on a dime, becoming a vicious demon…weaponized. An ice-cold heart can sometimes be a sword, and at others, armor.
