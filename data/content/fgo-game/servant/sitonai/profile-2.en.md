### Bond 2

A girl with an innocent smile. And yet, she hides an immeasurably cruel side as well. Her personality is indeed quite similar to the homunculus who serves as her body. The bravery that lets her fight so uncharacteristically for a girl her age comes from the Ainu’s young heroine Sitonai. Her sympathy and melancholy towards those for whom she has deep affection comes from the goddess Freyja. The iron will that lets her murder enemies in cold blood comes from the witch Louhi.

…At least it’s easy to attribute all these various aspects of her personality to the goddesses that fused to create this Alter Ego, but for now, her general personality comes from her vessel.
