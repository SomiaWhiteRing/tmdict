### Bond 3

Bunyan loves people, and so she continues to discover, expand, and develop uncharted lands because she believes that the continued progress of civilization truly leads to peoples’ happiness.
She will not give a second thought to destroying great swaths of nature if it means the people can live wealthy, comfortable lives.
How her actions will affect humanity in the future…the young Bunyan has no way of knowing at this point.
