### Bond 2

A girl of madness who has drowned herself in love who kisses bloody lips.
She is a dancer who captivated even her adoptive father, the king, and she covers herself with a thin veil.
She is vicious and cruel, and she is excited at the sight of her loved one’s blood.
She was just a pure girl during her lifetime, but it’s assumed that she manifested in the mental state from the moment she fell in love and went mad.

#### Madness Enhancement: C-

Communication is possible, but Salome’s mental state as a Servant is constantly broken.
While it may look like conversation is established on a surface level, one must remain wary.
