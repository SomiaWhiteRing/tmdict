### Bond 3

As someone who was supposed to have offered her love only to John the Immerser, the Servant Salome pours out her love generously. In other words, she shows affection even to her enemies.
If controlled properly, she should operate as a powerful Berserker, but every time she kills a targeted loved one, Salomeâ€™s mind deteriorates further.
