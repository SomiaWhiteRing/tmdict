I Have Kissed Thy Mouth.
Its appearance is that of a crystal skull.
A trophy that Salome gained through yearning, insanity, and fresh blood…in other words, it’s the crystallized head of John the Baptist.
Normally palm-sized, but able to grow or shrink at Salome’s will.
There were many legends that John the Baptist exercised various magecraft disciplines, so his head is a mass of Mystics, almost like a type of Mystic Code. Its possessor should be able to make use of many magecrafts…even if they don’t have any circuits.

At the time of True Name Revelation, the crystal skull becomes gigantic and preys on the enemy. At the highest level of Ascension, the skull changes from crystal to gold.
