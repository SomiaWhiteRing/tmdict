### Bond 5

Salome correctly understands what the relationship between a Master and Servant is meant to be.
She does…but as her and her Master’s bonds deepen and grow more intimate, she will eventually desire to “own” her Master.

She will seek…
…their head.

As she is aware that she cannot maintain her manifestation if Master loses their life, she will not actively attempt to take their head, but if the right opportunity arises…
Will she be able to resist…?
