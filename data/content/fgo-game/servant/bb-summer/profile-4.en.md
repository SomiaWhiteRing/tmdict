### Bond 4

#### Self-Modification: EX

A skill that BB normally possesses, which focuses on modifying one’s own self. She seems to have used it inadvertently this time. At the resort at the world’s end…humans, brace yourselves. The stars seem to have aligned in her favor.

#### Aurea Pork Poculum: A

The golden pig goblet. It was said that Pele deeply loved the demi-god of hogs, Kamapua’a, even though she relentlessly insulted him. Since BB calls everyone she loves her little pigs, it’s as if these two were meant for each other. This is the Hawaiian version of Aurea Poculum. Unlike the original version, she uses this skill on herself. Note that when BB drinks this, it flips her sadistic switch.

#### Faceless Moon: EX

A remnant of a certain god’s power that leads humans to destruction by putting them through various trials. Also known as the third eye. It actualizes the imaginary dimension’s interface, and is a Reality Marble that drops its surroundings into the Far Side of the Moon (shadow phase). When the world is blanketed by the shadow of the moon, time freezes.
