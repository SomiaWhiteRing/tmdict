### Bond 3

BB fused herself with two divinities. The first is the goddess of Hawaii, Pele. After assimilating with Pele, the immortal incarnation of Hawaiian volcanoes, BB changed her form to give herself the sun-kissed skin appropriate for the tropics, and her personality has become much more aggressive.
And thus Sun-Kissed BB was born.

By installing Pele’s violent, self-centered aspects as well as her tendency to kill anything in her way, BB transformed into a super sadistic goddess who drives those she loves nuts until they finally die.

“But that’s not really any different than the normal BB.”
…So says the Master who BB has ceaselessly victimized.
