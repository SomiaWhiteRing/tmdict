Cursed Cutting Crater
A cursed hole that carves a chunk out of the world. An attack used by the Mooncell’s BB from “CCC.” By expanding her own shadow, the surrounding area is converted into an imaginary dimension, and the world and all living creatures there are downgraded into low-level existences to become playthings of the ruler of this realm of madness.

The normal BB’s Noble Phantasm was a type of “surgery” that ridiculed her enemy while she was dressed in a cute nurse’s outfit and enjoying her own cruelty. However, this Noble Phantasm is a full-on operation that unleashes BB’s abilities to their fullest. As the original heroine of horror, she strives to be like a final boss unleashing its last strike while getting a reaction like, “Whoa, she’s ginormous! Scary! We’re in serious trouble!” After turning herself into an enormously powerful giant, BB easily rips up the ground and invades that world as if it were no more difficult than scooping up a spoonful of pudding.

Apparently, the second divinity she fused with won’t make its appearance here until her third Ascension…
