### Bond 2

The little devil kouhai heroine makes her dashing return from the Far Side of the Moon! As a brilliant, precocious little kouhai, she wraps senpai (Master) around her little finger. Though she calls herself a little devil (or a great devil, really), BB was unable to completely commit herself to becoming a true devil because she was fundamentally a good girl. But this BB is a different story. BB in her first Ascension is like a cheerleader rooting for Master, but when she reaches second and third Ascensions, her secret nature comes to light.

The Alter Egos that she created as her other selves (Passionlip and Meltryllis) were High Servants who were synthesized using goddess essences, but now BB has fused with various divinities to be reborn with a more aggressive Spirit Origin.
