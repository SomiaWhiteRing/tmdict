### Bond 5

Francis Drake was the first person in history to successfully navigate the globe alive. (Magellan, the first to try, died along the way.)
The historical Drake was male, but in this game she appears as a woman. The reason for this is that no one around Drake would treat her as a woman. According to her crew: “You know, if we call her a woman, then I don’t know how we could be men… and it’ll be rude to her, too.”
