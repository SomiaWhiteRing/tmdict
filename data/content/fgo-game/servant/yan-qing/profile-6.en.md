### Clear 「A Certain Chivalrous Man’s Death」

His master turned a deaf ear to his warnings till the very end. Rather than grief, Yan Qing felt only fury at this behavior. He blamed his master for placing more trust in a complete stranger than his loyal followers, and blamed himself for not putting even his own life on the line to persuade his master not to do so. And so he did not wish to ever serve another master again. Still, should someone employ his services, he would offer his advice as if his own life depended upon it this time around. Even if he has to break his master’s leg, or even kill his master to do it…he will prove that he is right.
