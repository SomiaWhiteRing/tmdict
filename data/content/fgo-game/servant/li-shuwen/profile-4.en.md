Divine Spear, No Second Strike.
Similar to Swallow Reversal, this is a spear technique ascended to the status of a Noble Phantasm due to its sheer mastery.
Its effects are the same as the “Wu Er Da” performed when he is summoned as Assassin.
It is assumed that even with wider range, the precision does not change.
