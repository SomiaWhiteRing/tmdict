### Bond 5

Li Shuwen can be summoned under three classes: Lancer, Berserker, and Assassin.
There are also instances of him being summoned as an old man.
The reason for this is when considering physical condition, his youth is at his peak. However, his mastery, the peak of his martial arts came after years of dedication. If a young Li Shuwen can be summoned as an Assassin, then it is also possible to summon an old Li Shuwen as Lancer.
