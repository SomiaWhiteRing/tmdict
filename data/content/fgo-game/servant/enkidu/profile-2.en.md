### Bond 2

One of the oldest heroes recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
A weapon made by the gods.
Originally created as a clay mold that could transform into anything.
Can transform into any form depending on necessity, with an entire body as a divine weapon.
Initially they did not think or feel like a human and were not that different than a wild beast.

After manifesting on earth, they learned many things from an encounter with a certain sacred prostitute, and eventually took the appearance of a human as a standard form.
This form was modeled after the sacred prostitute out of reverence.
