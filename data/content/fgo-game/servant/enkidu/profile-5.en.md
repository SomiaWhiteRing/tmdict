### Bond 5

#### Transformation: A

This special skill allows the redistribution of attribute points while retaining the same total score.
This is what makes Enkidu most unique.
The higher the rank, the greater the total amount of points.
Sometimes they might choose to set their Strength to A, and at other times, Endurance.
However, since there is a limit to how the parameters can be transformed, all values cannot be set to A at once.
Enkidu possesses 30 points, with each parameter
requiring the following values:
A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3.

#### Presence Detection: A+

The highest class of presence detection ability.
Distant presences can be detected through the earth.

#### Perfect Form: A

Uses the magical energy of the earth to restore their original form.
Enkiduâ€™s body is made of clay from the Age of Gods, and cannot be destroyed as long as there is magical energy available from the earth.
These regeneration and restoration capabilities are unparalleled.
Their soul, however, is a different matter.
