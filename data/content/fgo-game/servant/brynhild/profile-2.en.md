### Bond 2

Quiet and devoted, a warrior maiden that fell on misfortune.
Her gentle smile hides traces of sadness.
She is the eldest of the Valkyries.
During her time as a Divine Spirit she was a puppet with little free will, but after incurring her fatherâ€™s wrath and being sent to earth, she took on human qualities and a personality through her encounter with Sigurd.
