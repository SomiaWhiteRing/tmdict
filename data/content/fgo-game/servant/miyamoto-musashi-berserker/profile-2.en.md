### Bond 2

A female swordmaster who is bright, cheerful, and dignified. All-in-all, she’s vibrant. In other words, she’s the usual Musashi. Yet, the allure of summer managed to infect even Musashi, making her even more of the above than usual. She loves anything fun. She loves jet skiing. And, of course, she loves to fight strong opponents!

“This time around, I’m going with a Western-style swordswoman look I always dreamed of pulling off to live a free-spirited yojinbou life!”
…At least, she says that with a bright smile on face.

The weapon she holds is a foam sword, made for safety, yet it still hurts for some reason.
When she’s in her third Ascension form, she pulls out a longsword called the Reverse Destructive Sword, Musashi’s Make.
It’s based on the wooden sword said to be used by the Musashi from Proper Human History, but it wasn’t made well, and it was damaged at the time of completion. However, she still uses the broken blades as both a long and short sword.
