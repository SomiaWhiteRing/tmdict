### Bond 5

#### Accel Turn: B

Swimsuit Ishtar’s skill that’s been copied visually.
Even though Ishtar was the victim of plagiarism, the only thing she could manage to say was “…she’s a genius!”

#### Fifth Zenith: B

A skill like Fifth Force, but not. Upon closer inspection, the word “force” has turned into “zenith.”
It’s a free forming sword that can turn from a pair of swords or a single sword at will.

#### Heavenly Demon’s Gaze: EX

The skill “Heavenly Eye” gone berserk.
Her own Spirit Origin goes berserk to the brink of collapse to gain an explosive ATK bonus. Upon execution, her “Heavenly Eye” is honed to the extreme to see through the enemy’s various defenses to annihilate them.
Since it sees through every defense within visual range, it affects not just an individual but entire groups as well.
