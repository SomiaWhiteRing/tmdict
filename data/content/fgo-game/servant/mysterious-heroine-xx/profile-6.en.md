### Bond 5

When X became a member of the Galactic Police, she saw this as a good opportunity and changed her name and registration to XX. As she gained a new identity, she was able to abandon all her past debts, and she established Special Investigation Division O that cracked down on Foreigners, the invaders from outside space. And so was born XX, huntress of the wicked.

Her whole Saber-hunter thing has kind of faded, and now she’s a Foreigner-hunter. Still, her desire to eradicate all Sabers hasn’t gone away, so she still has her Saber special attacks.

#### Motivation, Behavior Towards Master

Partner on Earth. A reliable wallet.

Since X has zero skills and awareness when it comes to romance, Master is more of a friend to her. Eventually, though, she realizes they are someone special.

“What’s this sensation I’m feeling in my chest…don’t tell me there’s a wicked Saber on this planet!?”

Her erroneous thinking leads her to miss her opportunity. She’s pretty much the same X, but she’s aware that she’s an officer, so tries to act more mature. Since she’s a few versions later (read: older) than X, she looks like an office worker worn out by the daily grind.
