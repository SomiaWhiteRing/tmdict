The Servant Universe Is the Cosmos.
Depending on her mood, she will shout either “Twinmyniad Disaster” or “Double X Dynamic,” but this Noble Phantasm’s True Name is “Etherspace, Yet Lawful.” The True Name represents and mirrors the Rhongomyniad that protects the laws of space. The Rhongomyniad LR’s safety limiters are removed, and it devastates Sabers by increasing its output. It’ll blow its target up, planet and all.

She rejects the notion of a right to remain silent or a right to an attorney, because she is the voice of judgment. This is a useful Noble Phantasm that is not only a Special Attack against Foreigners, but also against Sabers.
