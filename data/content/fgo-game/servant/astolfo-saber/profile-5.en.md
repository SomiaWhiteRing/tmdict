Irrational Idol Going Berserk.
A sealed secondary Noble Phantasm. This Noble Phantasm can call upon Hippogriff’s power when summoned as a Rider. It’s everywhere yet nowhere, and its imaginary existence confuses the enemy. In this particular case, Astolfo not only creates many clones, but also creates uncertainty about whether they are truly there or not, enabling a form of evasion. Making matters worse, after enough time passes, the Astolfo clones multiply exponentially, leaving almost a hundred Astolfos running amok…

The idea of a hundred Astolfos chanting and screaming as if at a concert is, to some Servants, a nightmare.
