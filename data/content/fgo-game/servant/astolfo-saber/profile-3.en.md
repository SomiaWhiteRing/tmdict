### Bond 3

Astolfo’s alignment remains Chaotic-Good, so if you really think about it, it’s still the same Astolfo, just carrying a sword. While at essence a Rider, Astolfo has abilities that are slightly improved due to wielding a sword.

As a Saber, Astolfo’s knightliness seems to have increased, which allows for about a five percent increase in politeness and sanity retention for about five seconds longer. It also means bowing five degrees lower and gripping your hand five times firmer when shaking it as well.
