The Lucky Capturing Net.
A net that is said to have the ability to capture even gods, set by the giant Caligorante. At least that was what it was supposed to be, but Caligorante hears the trumpet of Astolfo’s magical horn and flees in fear, ironically falling into his own net.

After far too many complications to note here, the net was reforged into a sword when Astolfo became a Saber. The blade is also known as a whip-sword or a chain-linked sword, which is the dream of all warriors.
