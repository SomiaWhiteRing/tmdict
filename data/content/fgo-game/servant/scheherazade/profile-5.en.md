### Clear Main Quest 「Temporary Retreat」

#### Storyteller: EX

A skill of one who can masterfully narrate a tale or legend. It’s a talent altogether different from writing a story manuscript. The speaker is aware of the listener’s mood and psychological state and adjusts accordingly. A communicative ability that specializes in improvisation.
A Heroic Spirit of a Japanese Rakugo narrator would also be likely to possess this skill.

#### Anti-Hero: A

Scheherazade’s version of this skill can only target kings.
As such, it is ranked A.
In her case, it is especially effective when used as a survival tactic against any being bearing the title of “king.” Using this skill, she assesses the king’s mood, personality, ability, principles, and conditions so that she will at least not be killed, no matter how difficult the king may be.
