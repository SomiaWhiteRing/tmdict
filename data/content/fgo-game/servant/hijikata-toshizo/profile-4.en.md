The Undying Makoto.
As long as he, and only he, is able to maintain his existence, the banner of makoto, or “sincerity,” will never die. A Noble Phantasm that weaves together both his discipline and madness.
While active, damage to his physical body is temporarily nullified, and he is able to continue the battle using any available means until the opponent falls. However, this is a double-edged sword, as once the effect wears off, the damage sustained and saved up is unleashed all at once.
