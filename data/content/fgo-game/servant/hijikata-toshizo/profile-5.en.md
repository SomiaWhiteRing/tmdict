### Bond 5

All members of the Shinsengumi, who all are master swordsmen themselves, admit they “never feel like I actually win against Hijikata, even if he loses.” That is the demon of the battlefield, Hijikata Toshizo’s sword of carnage.
Such a spectacle is truly a reflection of his never-ending life of fighting. When activated, his surroundings become a battlefield where the air is shredded by flying bullets and filled with the echoing booms of gunfire.
While it may appear like an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm that summons multiple people, its true nature is completely different. This is a manifestation of his madness, his insistence that the “Shinsengumi will never fade.”
