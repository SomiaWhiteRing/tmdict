### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

#### Multi-Colored Tranquility: EX

Open your eyes, and you will see a flesh-colored
plain that sprawls across endlessly.
You stand in the palm of the Demonic
Bodhisattva.
At the far end of the horizon, Kiara gently smiles.

“Humanity is nothing but young beasts.
Ephemeral fruit that devours, melts, and drowns in
their desires.”

If this goddess embraces such bestial beings with the tenderness of a Bodhisattva, who could deny this great and infinite love?
 
Enlightenment and Nirvana are hers to command. Your final destination is the paradise that is Sessyoin.

…As you can see, no matter how strong you are, you are powerless before the heavenly demon. All beings possessed of reason, who understand joy and suffering, find themselves unable to resist the call of the salvation she offers. It is, of course, no salvation at all. Sweet as it sounds to call it the benevolence of the Bodhisattva, that is only how her victims can understand it. To Kiara, those held in her palm are no more than insects.
