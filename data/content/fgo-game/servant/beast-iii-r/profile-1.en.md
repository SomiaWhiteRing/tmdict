### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

A being of pure narcissism who values only pleasure.
A calamity that destroys both humans and animals, that uses, consumes, and absorbs all life for its own selfish desires.

Any who learn of this woman can at first see only her saintlike benevolence, and join the faith as she utterly enthralls them. As time goes on, members of the faith grow increasingly indulgent in pursuit of their desires, hoping for nothing more than her love. Their desires fade, though, even as they are fulfilled. That slow fading, however, does not please her, and eventually every follower falls from her good graces. Despairing that she will never love them, they end their own lives. So her victims’ bodies and fortunes all belong to her in the end.

She is a being of pure evil, and yet insists with absolute conviction that her actions are in fact good.
While she would never lie to herself, she preys on all around her with honeyed, poisonous lies, and consumes everything in her path. Her surety and doubtless ego have brought her to true enlightenment, at least from the perspective of a layman. If one were to think of her as a saint, that could be the only reason why.
