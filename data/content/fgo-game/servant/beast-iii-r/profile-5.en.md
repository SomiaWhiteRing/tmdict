### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

#### Karmaphage: EX

When Kiara converted her own body into SE.RA.PH, her five senses…her erogenous zones…were split into various skills and given to others.
The process is thought to be similar and copied the way BB created the Alter Egos when she deemed her love for humans to be superfluous.
It is abbreviated as KP, and the Sentinels were named “body,” “site,” “mouth,” “spice,” and “organ.” Each of these Sentinels is forced to use Kiara’s Authority, making them extraordinarily powerful Servants.

#### Heaven’s Hole

A subtype of the Third Magic.
It has the ability to draw in matter with incredibly powerful gravity on the level of a black hole, but it’s said to be nothing but a hole for waste, such as the unfavorable aspects people retain even as they do good deeds. The “Hole of the Heavens” embraces all the negative information associated with humanity’s egocentricity, or all the world’s greed, and continues to grow. They are undoubtedly hideous deposits, but this hole is an indispensable structure in society. As long as intellectual activity persists, it will continue to grow.
It will continue to contain the ugly desires that should not be present in humans.
