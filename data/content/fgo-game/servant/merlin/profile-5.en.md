### Bond 5

#### Hero Creation: EX

The skill to cause the birth of a king and raise them.
Merlin can be said to be King Arthur’s true father, and is one of the most famous kingmakers in the world.

#### Mixed Blood: EX

Has the blood of a non-human within him. Merlin is part incubus, and has inherited its special traits.

#### Self-Manifestation: A

The ability to manifest in the world on one’s own.
Merlin is not normally summoned as a Heroic Spirit. This is because there is no future where he can die.
He serves his Master as a Servant to vent his selfish desires, which could essentially be called a hobby.
In order to indulge this hobby of his, he single-handedly obtained this skill that only a certain special class could possess, and pretends to be summoned as a Servant.
