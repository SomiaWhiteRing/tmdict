World Faith Domination.
Illusionary domination through Edison’s three great inventions.
By creating devices that can illuminate light, record fleeting sounds, and capture reality, Edison was able to make the hidden secrets of the world disappear.
More accurately, “What was hidden by the world, is now taken back by Edison.”
Forcefully exposing the powers that work as part of the Mystics, fixating anything can’t be measured with energy as zero, and reducing people’s faith and belief in Mystics to nothingness. An anti-populace Noble Phantasm that “dominates over people’s faith.”
