### Bond 2

A young boy who led the Shimabara Rebellion during the early days of the Edo period.
From a young age he was a dutiful student, who one day began to perform various miracles.
He healed wounds, walked on water, and was soon worshipped by peasants who followed the forbidden religion as a child of God.
