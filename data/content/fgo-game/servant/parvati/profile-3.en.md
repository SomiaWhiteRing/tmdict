Knowing Love and Not Acting on It Is To Be Without It
A limited release of Trishula, a trident that Pārvatī borrowed from Shiva, which itself decided her Class, giving her the right to manifest as a Lancer.
Obviously, she is unable to wield the weapon as effectively as Shiva, but that in return helps her to maintain her foundation as a Servant.
