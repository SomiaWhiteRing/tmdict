### Bond 4

#### Ash of Kama: EX

Pārvatī is a mild-mannered goddess who is weak in battle.
But that doesn’t mean she is faint of heart.
Her feelings for those she loves are stronger than any other god.
For her loved ones, even should it burn her own body to ash, she would tap into and ignite her Divinity to convert it into the power she needs to fight.
Her flame may be brief, but its intensity rivals even the power of Kali, the goddess of destruction and another of Shiva’s wives.

It is worth noting that Shiva’s feelings are not a factor in this skill. She possesses special characteristics that allow her to intensify her love for someone, even should that loved one elect to ignore her.
Her love may be sincere, but…well, it’s pretty heavy, like…on a mythological level.

#### Grace of a Goddess: A+

A gift from a goddess (Good).
Legend tells of Pārvatī slashing her own throat to provide her blood to a follower dying of thirst.

#### Core of the Goddess: B

A unique skill that shows she was the perfect goddess from birth. Upholds the absoluteness of the psyche and the physical body. She repels any psychic interference, and her physical body does not age or change, no matter how many calories she ingests. As she is a Pseudo-Servant, its rank is capped at B. But that doesn’t matter.
My physique! Won’t! Change!
