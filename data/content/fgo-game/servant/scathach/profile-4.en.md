### Bond 4

Proud, and serves no one.
A born member of the ruling class.
She was born to be a ruler, and knows more than anyone that she can be a queen who brings happiness to her people.
She also knows, more than anyone, that sheâ€™s more talented than normal people.
Her way of life, her very being, and the color of her eyes, are all too similar to a certain someone in the 20th century Tokyo.
