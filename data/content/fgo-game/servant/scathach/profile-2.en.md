### Bond 2

#### Wisdom of Dún Scáith: A+

Because she has surpassed humanity, killed a god, and placed herself “outside” of the world, she is able to use all skills at the rank of B to A except for exclusive skills used by certain heroes.
Also, she’s able to pass down the skills to anyone she recognizes as a true hero.
In battle, she uses “Clairvoyance” frequently to predict the outcome of the battle.
In Ulster legend, she even used this skill to prophesize the future, including the death of her dear disciple, Cú Chulainn.
