Our Lord in Heaven, Have Pity on Me!
Derived from a monstrous, murderous rage that none could ever hope to suppress. Salieri compresses, solidifies, and then combines this fury with magical energy to play a tune of destruction that shreds the body and mind of his target. This musical Noble Phantasm is something that Antonio Salieri could never have possessed while living. It is a special ability that only Salieri the Avenger-class Servant, the Innocent Monster, may wield.

…In a cruel twist of fate, the Avenger Salieri will never be able to hear the music he plays—considered to be equal to Amadeus’s own work—as sound.
