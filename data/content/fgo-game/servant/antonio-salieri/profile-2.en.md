### Bond 2

A most excellent Servant who will, whenever ordered by his master, brutally attack and destroy all assigned targets. Never once does his own humanity interfere.

Though typically calm and collected, his mental state is compromised as a result of becoming an Innocent Monster. His fusion with the Man in Grey, a being of myth not unlike the Grim Reaper, has only exacerbated the problem. The instant he sees Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, he will ignore his Masterâ€™s orders and become nothing more than a harbinger of death.
