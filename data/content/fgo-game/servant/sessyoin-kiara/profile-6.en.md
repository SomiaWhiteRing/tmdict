### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

In FGO, she appears as a staff member of the Offshore Oil Rig, Seraphix.
When she was first assigned to a Western church, she was exasperated because she was Buddhist, but she put her heart and soul into her work.
At that point, Kiara was undoubtedly a saint, but in January of 2019, the Demon God Zepar, who escaped from the Temple of Time, took over her body, and she transformed into a puppet of the Demon God Pillars used to rule Seraphix.

…But that was only the beginning. At some point, Kiara turned the tables, taking Zepar over and becoming a demonic being with control over the Demon God Pillars. Over time, she changed into a Beast. Searching through multiple parallel worlds, Kiara sought out the most powerful, perfect version of herself and fused with her.
This brought the Void Phenomenon of CCC into the FGO world, and she transformed her own body into SE.RA.PH, growing by using Servants as a source of nutrition.
Her intent from there was to merge with the Earth, but her plan was ultimately foiled by Meltryllis, BB, Passionlip, and Chaldea’s Master.

Once she turned into an Alter Ego, she calmed down a bit.
Specifically, she vowed to herself that she would live a life of abstinence until her contract expires.
And so, while her personality has not changed, she has stopped thinking of everything that crosses her path as prey.
Her behavior towards Master is not unlike the demon Mara in Buddhist teachings. While she anxiously awaits the day when her Master buckles under the pressure of desire and drowns within themselves, she also is rooting for her Master to resist the exquisite temptation she represents.
