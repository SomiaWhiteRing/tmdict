Heavenly Pleasure, Mandala of the Womb Realm.
An Anti-Humanity or Anti-Grand Noble Phantasm.
Beast III’s unique Noble Phantasm that breeds what is said to be an infinite number of Demon God Pillars within her womb.
Her physical body is essentially limitless space, and a Pure Land of Paradise.
Those swallowed up within it are torn from reality, their sense of self unraveled, their reasoning melted away.
No matter how sturdy one’s physique or armor is, such things are meaningless within Kiara’s body. All things are reduced to a state like a newborn, which is later delivered.
In Beast III, it is an actual hole, but those who fall inside experience orgiastic pleasure before they disappear, and are absorbed into Kiara while basking in ecstasy.
This manner of death means the release from the suffering of reality, and depending on one’s perspective, it could be a kind of salvation.
