### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

Introverted. Strong-willed. Passive.
An easy-going king who seems incapable of taking things seriously.
Strong-willed though he may be, this is only because he is unable to read the room.
For this reason, he ends up making bullish comments, but is actually a coward at heart. He is earnest but never serious, and lives his life using only 80% of his full potential.
It is astonishing that he managed to judge men and laws, and was a good ruler of his nation. He may have lacked spirit, but he was loved by his people for his wisdom, kindness, and affection for them.

…But none of these characteristics were of Solomon’s own choosing.
Solomon was destined to be a king from birth, and he had no choice but to hear the voice of God and do as He said.
The king was an unemotional, inhuman person who was stripped of his ability to sympathize with the sorrows and joys of others.
