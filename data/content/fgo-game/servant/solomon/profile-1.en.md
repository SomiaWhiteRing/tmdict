### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

Solomon married the daughter of Egypt’s pharaoh, but one night God appeared in his dream and said, “You are worthy, so ask and you shall receive.”
Solomon wished for wisdom instead of gold or power, and God was satisfied with his answer. It showed that he had the right to attain true wisdom.
When Solomon awoke, there were ten rings on his fingers, given as proof that he was deemed wise by God. 
Later they would be known as the Rings of Solomon, which become a source of magecraft that let one command angels and demons.
