Tokonatsu Nikkou: Hiyoke Gasa Chouai Isshin.
A play on words because a parasol keeps both the sun and the monsters away.
It also carries the connotation of warding off any bad bugs that cling to Master.
In certain parts of the world it’s called the “Polygamist Castration Fist.”
Naturally, it gets an attack bonus on men.
Robin Hood would (most likely) know more details.
