### Bond 5

#### Beach Flower: EX

A true personification of a sunflower.
The Summer Goddess is here at last!
“You know that I am actually a goddess, right?”
Summer Tamamo wants to show off her beauty as a woman, but isn’t down for a “Love Trap.”
If you give her a parasol, beach, and summer, she will use that chance to show off her grace. She wants to show off her charm even more in the summer beach, so when you go back home, you’ll be completely smitten by her.
“Instead of a lady, shouldn’t you be called a hunter?”
“That’s right, Master. While she is the original, she’s also like one of the Tamamo Nine. People call her Tamamo Shark, the Ocean Hunter.”
