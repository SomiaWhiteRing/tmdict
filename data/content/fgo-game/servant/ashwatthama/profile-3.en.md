O Chakra, Provoke My Blazing Rage.
In a rare occurrence, this is a Noble Phantasm that was not used, or rather, could not be used during his lifetime.
This giant chakram is something he wields only when summoned as a Servant rather than something from his myth, engraving his use of it as a weapon onto his memory as a warrior.
In other words, his use of the chakram is strictly self-taught, and his moves are unique to him.
