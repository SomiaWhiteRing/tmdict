### Clear Interlude 「After the Rage」

He was severely punished for tarnishing his soldier’s honor. He was forced to give up the gemstone he had on his forehead since birth. And he was exiled to a forest.

It is said that he wandered through the forest for three thousand years.

When he was summoned as a Servant, he thought he could be a proper, respectable soldier this time around, but at the same time, if his Master is someone worthy of respect, he wouldn’t mind wandering through the forest for a long time once again.

He is a soldier of passion.
