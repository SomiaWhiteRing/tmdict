One, a hero must be invincible.
Two, a hero must be constantly excited.
Three, a hero is free to use anything they find lying on the ground.

Consumes a large amount of hero power in exchange for a super power-up. 
A buff that can rival Tamamo Summer’s Goddess Morph. 
But, despite this skill having such activation requirements, it still has random elements, so it’s really just for show.
