### Clear Main Quest 「See You Again Someday, Flower at the Apex of Heaven」

Despite offering her entire heart to her lord Yoshinaka, she was unable to be with him at the end…
That is the one regret this woman warrior carries in her heart.
In Seven Duels of Swordmasters, her silent sorrow was transformed into burning anger by Ashiya Douman, which turned her into a savage monster of flames who incinerated all of Sagami Province.
She is normally a delicate maiden who loves nature and detests altercations between humans.
Tomoe Gozen’s view of life and death is clear-cut: she believes she is a transient guest in the form of a Servant, and knows with certainty that she is destined to vanish from the face of the earth. Even when summoned to the Absolute Demonic Front of Babylonia, she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself in a desperate attack on the enemy’s general, Girtablilu.
