### Clear Main Quest 「Seconda Cantica: Inferno (Ending)」

#### Knowledge of Combat: B

A skill for large-scale battles where allies and enemies are pressed close together.
This skill is not for commanding troops. Rather, it grants one the ability to fight bravely in such a frenetic conflict. Many against many, one against many…those are the battles to which Tomoe is accustomed.

#### Lineage Excitation: A

A type of self-hypnosis Tomoe used unconsciously during her lifetime.
Upon her manifestation as a Servant, this has been defined as a skill that temporarily increases her oni strength.
