### Bond 4

#### Innocent Kaiju: EX

An id_es skill altered from its base, “Innocent Monster.”
As an iron dragon girl, Mecha Eli-chan uses the power of movie-making special effects to fly through the air, breathe fire, shoot electricity, and fire missiles.
Her capabilities are truly befitting a guardian god of iron. The user of this skill believes a villainous theme song should play when she employs it.

#### Overload Type II: C

A skill altered from the one that Frankenstein and Babbage possess.
While the Noble Phantasm is not strengthened, HP is sacrificed to increase the NP gauge. According to a robotics researcher identified only by the initial M:
“Is the battery leaking or something?”

#### Mecha Eli Punch: EX

Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II summons her superstructure’s hand to attack.
As there is a strange rule stating that this skill can only be used when she is an enemy of humanity, she is unable to use it if she gains a Master.
