### Bond 5

A cool girl who detests being called “Mecha Eli-chan,” and insists on simply being called “Mk.II”.
She looks down on humans and considers them to be nothing more than decorations for her nation. It is her practice to manage humans forcibly should they elect to disobey her.

…Yet, she is aware that such thoughts are not good for the people, so she does not call herself the “law for goodness.”

She rules by being evil to humans, and makes it the peoples’ first task to be good.
Such is the evil Mecha Eli-chan who possesses these convictions hidden beneath her disdain for humanity.
