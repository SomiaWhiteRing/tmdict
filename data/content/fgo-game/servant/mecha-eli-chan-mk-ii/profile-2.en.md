### Bond 2

Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II.
While Mk.Iâ€™s attributes as the lord of the land made her strong, this model was made strong through her attributes as a guardian god.
She lives by the laws of the gods rather than the laws of humans.
The intelligence and diplomatic grace of a lord are gone, leaving her instead as a merciless defender against humanity (external enemies).

Though she no longer has grotesque thoughts of showering herself with the blood of young girls to maintain her beauty, she did manage to hang onto that cruel, sadistic nature.
