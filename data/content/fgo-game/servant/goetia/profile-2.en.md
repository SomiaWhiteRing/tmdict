### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

A Beast who calls himself the King of Demon Gods.
He possesses a sense of omnipotence which commands all the laws of the earth and the heavens, and holds a hatred so great it is as if he despises all of mankind. He wears ten rings, one on each of his fingers, but the left middle ring is a replica.

As King Solomon is his base, he had a terrifying but logical personality.
However, since he is an amalgamation of the 72 Demon Gods, he also has 72 personalities and natures. He is both one and a colony, and so when he talks with others, the Demon God most similar to that person appears on the surface. This is why Goetia’s disposition has been described as a mirror.

He is the omnipotent being that even Solomon could not become. He was more than capable of becoming a king that could rule over man. But because of his omnipotence, he could not understand human nature, and because he was immortal he was not able to reach an answer. Thus, he was never able to become the “king of man.”
