### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

#### Summoning: EX

Magecraft where spirits from the past or from the future are evoked.  
After King Solomon’s death, the concepts called the 72 Demon Gods which were left behind dwelled inside King Solomon’s corpse. After a long time, something wearing King Solomon’s skin was born. 
Though this skill cannot be used to summon normal familiars or Heroic Spirits, he is able to summon any of the 72 demons at will. It is easier to understand him as a generator that projects the “fictional demon gods” that had nested inside King Solomon’s inner world to the outsider world.

#### Revelation: -

A skill that makes one capable of hearing the voice of Heaven and take the most appropriate action accordingly.
As this is a skill within the soul, Goetia, who nests inside King Solomon’s corpse, cannot use it.

#### Clairvoyance: EX

As clairvoyance is a skill retained by the body, Goetia is able to use it.
