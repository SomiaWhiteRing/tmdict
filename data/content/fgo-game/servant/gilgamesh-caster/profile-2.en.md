### Bond 2

#### Item Construction (Fake): A

The ability to create magical tools.
Gilgamesh isnâ€™t normally a mage, so it would not be possible for him to have this ability, but the existence of his Noble Phantasm gives him a similar power. The tools he creates (summoned from his Noble Phantasm) are all things from the treasury of Babylon.
