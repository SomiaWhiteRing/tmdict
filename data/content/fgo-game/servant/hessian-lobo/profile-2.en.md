### Clear Main Quest 「Return of the Wolf King」

Lobo the Wolf King was originally a real grey wolf who became famous through Ernest Thompson Seton’s book “Wild Animals I Have Known.”
The book describes how he roamed rampant across the Currumpaw plains, killing two thousand cattle in five years and two hundred and fifty sheep in a single night.
Naturally, the pasture owners tried every poison, gun, and trap in the book to capture him, but Lobo didn’t pay them any mind.
