### Clear 「Perseverance Will Prevail」

As Lancer Li Shuwen is in his physical prime, fighting against him is one of Assassin Li Shuwen's dearest desires.

Should Assassin Li Shuwen confront him, he cannot guarantee that he would be able to maintain his composure. And even if he was able to compose himself, there is no guarantee his opponent could do the same.

He is therefore quite sure that any encounter with Lancer Li Shuwen will lead to a fight to the death.
