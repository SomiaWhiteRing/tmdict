### Bond 4

#### Sphere Boundary (Extreme): A-

A technique that allows him to detect his surroundings and conceal his presence using his qi. Those who have mastered this can unite with the heavens and earth, making it possible for them to fade into nature. In his old age, his technique had evolved further. Even during active combat, he is able to disappear in the blink of an eye.

#### Intersection of Yin-Yang: B

A switch of human nature. Though he leans more towards yang energies as he aged, his ferocious fangs were never lost, and they can slaughter the enemy by switching to yin in an instant. He has lost none of his ruthlessness.
