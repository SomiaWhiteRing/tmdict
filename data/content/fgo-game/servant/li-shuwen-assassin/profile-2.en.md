### Bond 2

In contrast to his younger self, this Li Shuwen is a mild-mannered old man. He may use his deadly fist at times, but only when absolutely necessary. This is because he has accepted peace, a state where he suppresses the urge for brutality in a way his young self would never have understood. However, enemies who face him will learn that the deadly skill of his youth is still being honed even to this day.
