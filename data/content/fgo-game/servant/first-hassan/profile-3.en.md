### Bond 3

The rot of the cult: in other words, the decline of the “Old Man of the Mountain.”
Be it a failure of the mind or of skill, the title “Old Man of the Mountain” cannot be held by one who has become weak.
Weakness is death. Beheading is both the pardon for that sin, and the hope entrusted to the next Old Man.
To make righteous his dreadful role of assassinating assassins, he chose not a hidden weapon, but a massive sword.
When someone sees his skull, their life is at an end.
After he has slain the fool who violated the cult’s teachings, all who have seen the skull swordsman vanish from the earth.
The skull swordsman is a living legend, and the abyss of assassins, whom none has ever witnessed.
