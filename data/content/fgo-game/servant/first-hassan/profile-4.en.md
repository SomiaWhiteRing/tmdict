Angel of Death.
An ordinary broadsword. The faith of the one who wields it for eternity has seeped into the blade.

This blade, held by the man who walks forever the border of the ghostly mountain abyss, adds an instant death attribute to all its attacks. The probability is low, but it threatens even the strongest foes with the peril of instantaneous death. Since those who dwell within the ghastly valley become one with death, he gains protection from instant death and charm attacks.
