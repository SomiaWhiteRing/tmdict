### Bond 3

A beautiful, elegant, and mature woman.
Also an honest professional soldier.
She cries a lot, especially when she gets worried about Kintoki.
She seems to be a peaceful person, but since she’s not fully human and has a divine heritage, she tends to be more objective and cares about the greater good.
On the other hand, she devotes herself to anyone she loves as the personification of maternal love. To her, a lover equals her own son, and she would do anything for her son. However, she doesn’t realize her own twisted view.
