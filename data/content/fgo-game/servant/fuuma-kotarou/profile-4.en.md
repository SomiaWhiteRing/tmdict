Instead of calling this Fuuma Kotarou’s Noble Phantasm, this is more like the Noble Phantasm of the Fuuma Ninja.
Summons the spirits of 200 Fuuma Ninja, turns the area surrounding the enemy into pure darkness, and then knocks them down straight to Hell. This is based off the tale of Kotarou leading 200 ninja into the Takeda base, killing injured soldiers and burning all their rations. Due to the continuous ambushes, the Takeda soldiers had no choice but to retreat.
