The three spirit demons (djinn) who serve the Queen appear, and attack her enemy.
The three djinns’ names are Ehad, Shtayim, and Shalosh.

The Queen once visited Jerusalem bearing splendid gifts to test the wisdom of the great and wise King Solomon with difficult questions. The three riddles, or enigmas, that were presented to the king were easily answered, and the Queen was impressed with the prosperity of Jerusalem. The Queen and King Solomon exchanged gifts, and then the Queen set off to return home.
