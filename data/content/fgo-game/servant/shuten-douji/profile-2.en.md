### Bond 2

In the imperial capital, the daughters and youths of noble families began to disappear one after another. Abe-no-Seimei’s divination revealed that Shuten-Douji was the one behind it. Minamoto-no-Raikou, along with the Four Heavenly Kings, disguised themselves as Buddhist monks and infiltrated the oni’s lair. During the banquet, they convinced Shuten-Douji and the other oni to drink poisoned alcohol, and in her weakened state, they finished her. It is said that after being decapitated, Shuten-Douji’s head suddenly attacked Raikou, but it was stopped by the helmet Raikou received from the gods.
