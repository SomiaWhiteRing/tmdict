### Bond 5

The Heroic Spirit Holmes does not take the form of Professor Joseph Bell (said to be the inspiration for the character Holmes), nor Doyle himself, nor of the worldâ€™s first detective by the name of Detective Vidocq, but rather that of the main character (at least, an individual who acts exactly like him) of the Holmes stories.

Are the stories of Sherlock Holmes a complete fabrication by Sir Doyle? Or could they be a biography of a real-life Holmes, recorded by Dr. John H. Watson? Or something in between?
Holmes himself should be very well aware of it, but seems unwilling to go into detail, and should the topic ever come up, he evades it gracefully without fail.
