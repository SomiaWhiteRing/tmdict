The Noble Phantasm Sherlock Holmes gained when he manifested as a Servant. A Noble Phantasm that sublimated the concept of investigation, the very source of his being.
Even if the mystery he faces is unsolvable, clues and paths leading to truth will always come to light.
Even should he come across a treasure chest with no key, the key is not lost, but rather is bound to be found somewhere in the world.
(However, the key does not, of course, spontaneously appear in his hands. Holmes must discover the key wherever it may be, alone or with the aid of another.)
