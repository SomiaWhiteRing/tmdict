### Bond 2

Oda Nobunaga. This version is closest to the real Nobunaga’s Spirit Origin… Maybe not the most accurate way to put it, but let’s just say it is for convenience’s sake.
They may have been summoned as an Avenger, but they are closer to their Archer self.

Yet as the enemy of the gods, Buddha, and all creatures, the multitudinous grudges and terror harbored within their body was too much to handle even as a Heroic Spirit, since the Spirit Origin was originally just from an ordinary human. Thus, undergoing multiple Ascensions enabled multiple aspects of Nobunaga to develop. Calling it a multitude of possibilities emerging may sound good on paper, but what actually happens is that one vanishes every time these divergences happen. Nobunaga figured this out, but does not bring it up.

As to armaments, they have gained mysterious weapons like the ultra matchlock rifles and something that resembles a Demon King gatling gun. Don’t you think a rotating, rapid-fire matchlock is absolutely badass!?

“Well, whatever form I take, don’t you think I’m still the most adorable one out there? And actually, don’t you think the biggest me’s kinda scary?”
