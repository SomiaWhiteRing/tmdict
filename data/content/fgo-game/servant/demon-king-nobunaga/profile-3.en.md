### Bond 3

Oda Kippoushi. The name Kippoushi was Oda Nobunaga’s childhood name. Since childhood, his peculiar behavior led to many calling him a fool.

This is the form of the young gallant warrior, the most dangerous he would be during the life where he earned his nickname “The Fool of Owari.” The ambition and passion positively radiating from him faithfully represents the Spirit Origin of Nobunaga the mercenary.

Also, the sword hanging at his hip is the sword he seized from Imagawa Yoshimoto at the Battle of Okehazama, named Souza Sanmonji.

“Actually I never called myself Kippoushi during that time. But then again, this is probably an easier way to know that we’re in this interesting situation where there are other Nobunagas other than me. Wahahahaha!”
