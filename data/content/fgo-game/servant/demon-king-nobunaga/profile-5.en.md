Hajun Henjou, Sanzen Daisenten Maou.
An aberrant form that contains all the fear and reverence for Nobunaga held by all creatures past, present, and future. That power now surpasses even that of the real Demon King of the Sixth Heaven. Nobunaga transforms into the true demon king, the Demon King of the Myriad Heavens that destroys various deities and Buddhas. This is the final form of the crimson Anti-Hero that incinerates the divine. This is Demon King Nobunaga.

Since this form did not exist in history, the existence itself is unstable, and so the manifestation only lasts a short while.
