### Bond 4

#### The Shadow Prefect: A

An altered version of Eternal Arms Mastery.
No matter what the situation, even if she’s lost her school uniform, no moral breakdown will escape her vigilance. 

#### Cast Iron Yo-yo: C

Kintoki’s notion that a sailor school uniform always paired with one of these seems to have spread to Raikou as well.
Because Raikou is able to practice every form of martial arts, she is able to wield a yo-yo with deadly skill, whacking any summer temptations that might threaten Chaldea’s moral integrity.

#### Summer Catastrophe: EX

It’s something to see even when she doesn’t strip…but it’s even more of a sight when she DOES!
A skill comparable to Summer Crisis, which tests how many gazing eyes are collected at the beach. Unlike Beach Flower, it draws attention far past the level of mere infatuation.
