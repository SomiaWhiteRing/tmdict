### Bond 2

Heracles goes mad multiple times in legend, but originally was an excellent warrior that could use many weapons. He has the capacity to qualify for all classes except Caster, and the best Noble Phantasm in his possession is the bow and arrow called “Nine Lives” that he gained during his Twelve Labors.
