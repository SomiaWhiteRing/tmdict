### Bond 3

#### Self-Evolution: EX

A self-improving skill that surpasses the Self-Modification skill.
Allows the user to evolve in a matter of seconds to overcome any obstacle and achieve their aims. Unfortunately, this skill is not as adaptable as Self-Modification, since it is intended for a very specialized purpose.

#### Feral Logic: B

An approach to combat that was born from her transformation into a beast. Drastically accelerates the thought processes that themselves lead to quick kills, but renders one unable to exploit the enemyâ€™s weakness in inventive ways. Use together with the Self-Evolution skill to defeat enemies even faster.
