### Bond 2

Even though her stat increase is equivalent to an A-rank Madness Enhancement, she is one of the few Berserkers who retains her calm, since her Demonic Beast form is a consequence of her covering herself in the Calydonian Boar hide. Since her transformation is not born of rage, but rather because of her being in a bestial form when she was summoned, its rank is lower than when it is used as a Noble Phantasm.
She can attack with all the ferocity of a beast, but still has the presence of mind to be able to retreat if she must. However, the moment she considers someone an enemy, it is not possible to talk her down.
