Dark Heavens, Corroding Arrow.
Tauropolos, which is used by her Archer form, is embedded within her to allow her to deal a devastating blow using all of her magical energy.
The attack itself is more akin to a ballistic missile than an arrow. The target is hit and then entrapped within a lingering, all-consuming darkness that devours them whole. To survive this would require an extremely powerful Magic Resistance skill.
