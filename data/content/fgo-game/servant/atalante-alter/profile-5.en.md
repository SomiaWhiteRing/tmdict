### Bond 5

While she is capable of communicating even with a skill similar to Madness Enhancement, it is more or less impossible to change her mind about anything using conventional logic.

She does not care whether you are an ally of humanity. So long as you do not prevent her from carrying out what she swore to herself to do—no matter how much of a beast she has become—she can be a very faithful Servant. She will, however, gladly abandon her Master should their relationship conflict with her own code. In such circumstances, she may not even recognize her own Master. Of course, so long as you don’t break her rule, this will never be an issue…
