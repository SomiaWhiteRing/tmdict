### Bond 2

The Titan Cronus took the form of a horse and lay with Philyra, who gave birth to Chiron, a half-man, half-equine centaur. Philyra was disgusted by her son’s monstrous form and refused to nurse him, and was transformed into a linden tree.

Though he never had his parents’ love, Chiron became a great sage, mastering many academic disciplines. That his mother, Philyra, and the linden tree share a name in Greek is no coincidence, as linden tree flowers are used as a stimulant, and its bark is often used for fortune-telling and signboards.

At the request of many throughout Greece, the adult Chiron took on the job of educating and training future heroes. Among those he educated were the great heroes Heracles and Achilles, Asclepius the god of medicine, as well as Castor, who later became the constellation Gemini. Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, also trained under Chiron.

Though, according to Jason, “When you get to be as awesome as me, such simple lessons are like nails on a chalkboard! I would’ve preferred to be taught how to deal with annoying women whenever I stumble across them!”
