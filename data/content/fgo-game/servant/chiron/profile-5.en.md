### Bond 5

Chiron, one of the prominent great sages of Greek myth, was hit by an arrow coated in a hydra’s venom. In order to escape from the pain, Chiron surrendered his immortality, which was the sole proof of his godly status. The Greek gods were saddened by Chiron’s death and raised him up to the heavens to became a constellation. However, the Chiron summoned here regrets that he gave up his immortality, and wishes to regain it. He desires this not to become a god once again, nor because he wishes to live forever, but rather to reclaim the one thing he inherited from his parents.
