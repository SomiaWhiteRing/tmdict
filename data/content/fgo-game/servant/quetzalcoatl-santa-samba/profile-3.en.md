### Bond 3

#### Sambista: B

Those who love samba.
Quetzalcoatl’s samba life may have started with a misunderstanding, but since she was so determined to go through with it, she educated herself on what samba was and arrived at the conclusion that, “Samba is really cool, yes!”

…Aaand that’s why she’s so obsessed with samba now, so much so that she thinks of it as a wonderful part of human culture developed during their wonderful growth.

The problem is…no one around her had any real knowledge of samba, so the style of samba that she studied and trained at so fervently may be a bit…unconventional. She doesn’t care. What really matters is her passion…right?
