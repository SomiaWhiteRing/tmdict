### Bond 3

#### Voyager of the Storm: A+

The ability to drive anything that’s recognized as a ship.
Because even the leader needs abilities of their own, this is a specialized skill that combines both Tactics and Charisma.
Bartholomew led the world’s largest pirate group and commanded absolute authority among them.

#### Pirate Gentleman: A

Despite being a pirate, Bartholomew obeyed the laws, living as a stylish, handsome gentleman.
This skill also comes from the fact that he divvied up his shares according to law.
There was also language touching on welfare and benefits, apparently.

#### Swift Pillager: A

A skill that determines how much one excels at pirating.
As the leader of the largest pirate crew in the world, Bartholomew was brilliant at this.

And from that, his piracy against forty-two Portuguese ships is legendary, where he not only stole sugar and cigars, but forty-thousand Moidore gold coins and even a cross set with diamonds made for the king of Portugal.
