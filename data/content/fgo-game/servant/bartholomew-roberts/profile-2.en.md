### Bond 2

A sharp dandy. His genial and attractive disposition is alluring to both men and women.
However, given he is a man who aspired to become a pirate, internally he is a good match against Blackbeard.
Bartholomew often complains that he doesn’t want to be lumped together as Blackbeard, but he’s only talking about the way he talks and looks. The idea that “pirates take and take and take everything, and then everything gets taken away at the end” rather lines up with Blackbeard’s philosophy.
