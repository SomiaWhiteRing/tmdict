### Bond 5

Bartholomew didn’t become a pirate because he wanted to be one. Originally Bartholomew was a second mate on a ship called the Princess, but the ship was captured by pirates led by Captain Davis, and he was forced to join the crew.
Yet, perhaps due to his innate disposition, after the death of Captain Davis, Bartholomew was selected to succeed him as captain by the rest of the crew. Surprisingly, this decision was made a mere six weeks after Bartholomew was recruited.

Though Bartholomew’s debut as a pirate was a resplendent one, there was a time when an adjutant of his took off with a ship and goods.
Because of this incident, Bartholomew vowed to never let anything like this happen again and drafted a pirate code. He forced his subordinates to repeat the code and made them swear an oath on a Bible.
The pirate law included equal distribution of booty, no drinking after eight o’clock at night (which unfortunately was never followed as strictly), no gambling and other related restrictions, as well as guaranteed money in case a crew member gets injured during active pirating and needs to retire.
Additionally, he also allowed people from ships he captured who refused to become pirates to be released, despite the opposition of most of his crew.
