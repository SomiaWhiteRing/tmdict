### Bond 3

She controls a dolphin as her familiar. His name is Reece, and he follows Jeanne’s orders, somehow walks on land, and flies the sky. He is highly intelligent, and is always popping up and trying to give us advice. No, we do not want any of these options! Oh, also, Jeanne met him after saving him from some sort of bind…quite a simple and typical girl-meets-dolphin story.
