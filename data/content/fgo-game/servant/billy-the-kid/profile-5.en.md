Thunderbolt of Broken Sound.
A three-shot counterattack fired from the Colt M1877 Double Action Revolver (AKA Thunderer) that Billy the Kid was said to have used.  This is the manifestation of his legends in the form of a Noble Phantasm.
Strictly speaking, the gun itself is not the Noble Phantasm, “the shot fired from this gun in the hand of Billy the Kid” is the Noble Phantasm. It’s closer to being a unique skill.
What makes this Noble Phantasm especially tricky is that the vast majority of its concept is devoted to “technique,” which reduces the amount of magical energy required. Specifically, it only requires the same amount as a Rank E Noble Phantasm.
