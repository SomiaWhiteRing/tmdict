Conjuration: Call Upon the Great God of Ibuki.
Using a curse associated with Kouga Saburou, the mythical forefather of the Mochizuki clan of Kouga, she temporarily borrows the divine power of a terrifying daimyoujin.
Specifically, through a medium, she gains limited control of the eight-headed serpent deity Yamata-no-Orochi.

The “Suwa Engi no Koto” folklore collection and “Daikouji Kannnondou Engi” both describe how Ibukidaimyoujin possessed Kouga Saburou, using his clothing as a medium. Ibukidaimyoujin, the presiding deity of Mt. Ibuki and the divided spirit of Yamata-no-Orochi, materializes to place a deadly curse on the target. 
Magical energy in the form of a giant serpent coils around the target, killing them.
