Stronghold of Impalement.
Countless stakes rise from the ground to strike the enemy. The curse of Dracula’s wrath is emitted from the spears.
Since it targets all his opponents, its true value is seen in a battle against multiple foes. 
Due to its origin, it’s said to increase the amount of pain the target feels in accordance with their wickedness or depravity. Inflicts greater damage to targets of his purge: those who committed the crimes of flight, depravity, or violence.
