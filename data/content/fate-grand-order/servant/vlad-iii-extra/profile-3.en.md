### Bond 3

Vlad III did whatever it took to protect the independence of Wallachia, and the Turks hated him as if he were a devil.
In the year of 1462, he adopted a scorched earth strategy and guerrilla tactics to fight a force of 150,000 Turks with only 10,000 men.
Evacuating his people to the Carpathian mountains, he emptied everything between the enemy and the capital.
When the enemy arrived, they were confronted with the impaled corpses of over 20,000 Turkish soldiers around the capital of Târgoviște.

A vast field of impaled bodies extended around the fortress of Târgoviște. Even the brave Turkish soldiers lost their will to fight in the face of the stench and horrifying sight.
Their commander, Mehmed II, known as “Mehmed the Conqueror,” said, “I fear no man, but a devil is a different matter,” as he pulled his army out.
The field of stakes was three kilometers long and one kilometer wide. Even after the Ottoman Empire conquered Wallachia in later years, they recognized the state’s autonomy out of the trauma from this experience.
