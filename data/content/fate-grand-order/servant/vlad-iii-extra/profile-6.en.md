### Clear Interlude 「Scorched Earth」

Immorality and corruption. Betrayal and mistrust. Violence and villainy.
The warrior vowed to protect his homeland from these detestable things. However, in attempting to eliminate such things, he chose an even darker path.
His armor is stained black with the dried blood of his enemies, his overcoat soaked crimson by the blood of traitors.
The purifying lance that once pitied the masses has become the dreaded impaling stake, judging the weaknesses of men.

That stake is Vlad III.
To execute justice, this man has abandoned the trappings of humanity.
