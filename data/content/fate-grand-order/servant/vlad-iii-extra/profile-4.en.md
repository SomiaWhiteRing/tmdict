### Bond 4

Dracula was originally a title he gave himself, meaning “Son of the Dragon.”
It comes from his father, Vlad II, who was a knight of the Holy Roman Empire’s Order of the Dragon and called himself “Dracul.” 
Vlad believed in the love of the Lord and tried to fulfill his duty as a nobleman by righting misdeeds. 
However, his honorable poverty was disliked by feudal lords of a wealthy privileged class, who conspired to slay the warrior who saved Christendom.
