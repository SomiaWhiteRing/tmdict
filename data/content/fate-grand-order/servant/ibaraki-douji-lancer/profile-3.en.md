“Wouldn’t that make me a kappa? Is it because my Spirit Origin changed? Wait a minute, now I think about it, Shuten may have been twisting my limbs and even cracking my bones right before summer started. But I’m sure it’s nothing bad since Shuten did it for me!”

…The thought made Ibaraki smile. Isn’t that nice?
