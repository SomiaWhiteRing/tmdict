### Bond 5

When its True Name is revealed, Ibaraki thinks she is unleashing a Heian Rocket Punch, or her sougenbi punishing flame. But for some reason, five spears that look like giant fingers appear, forming a huge fist that unleashes a devastating uppercut. Her victim is sent sky high, and disintegrates in a dazzling display of flame, like fireworks in the summer sky…

Five giant fingers…

“Those five spears aren’t MY fingers…are they!?”

Note: Jeanne d’Arc Alter was apparently commissioned to come up with the True Name “Encomium Moriae” and its reading.
