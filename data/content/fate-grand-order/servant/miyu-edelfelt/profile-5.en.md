Sakatsuki of the Earth, Shining in the Starry Sky.
The God Child’s ability to grant wishes is temporarily wielded in a limited fashion. Since the Noble Phantasm is realized by focusing on Master’s single wish to protect humanity, a trusting relationship is absolutely essential to success.

Her older brother told her that wishes should be made on the stars instead of the moon, and she still holds that belief. The Earth’s moon that shines with the wishes of so many instead casts its light into the great beyond.
