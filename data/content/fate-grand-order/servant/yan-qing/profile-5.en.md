A shadow cloning strike that makes use of Yan Qing’s unique footwork.
While it may not quite reach the level of magic, this high-speed footwork is still fast enough to be imperceptible to a third party’s senses, and Yan Qing makes full use of it to deliver a series of blows.
It is said that he moves so swiftly that his shadow doesn’t even have time to reach the ground.
