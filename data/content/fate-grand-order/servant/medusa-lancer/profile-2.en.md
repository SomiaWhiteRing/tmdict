### Bond 2

She is a pretty young girl who closely resembles her two sisters, and her personality is different than when summoned as a Rider.
Unlike her sisters, eternal children who cannot survive without anotherâ€™s help, she already has the power to fight. The seeds of an evil that could take innumerable lives sleep within her.
