Four Poems by Emperor Chongzhen.
Four poems were bestowed to Qin Liangyu by her emperor, Chongzhen. When Qin Liangyu was summoned to the capital, she assumed that she was going to be held responsible for failing to suppress thieves, so she gave all her possessions and property to her subordinates and braced for the worst. But what she received instead was a reward and four poems that praised her, said to have been written by the emperor himself.
