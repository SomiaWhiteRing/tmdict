Dawn of Destruction.
While it possesses an affinity for the sun, this rare Noble Phantasm is realized as a demonic sword. This sword, a gift from Odin the Allfather, is not only a sword of royal selection, but it also is said to be a rare type of weapon that brings glory, jealousy, destruction, and destiny to the wielder.
In FGO, this sword is his standard armament.

Heavenly Wheel of Destruction.
The fully unleashed version of the Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm, Gram.
Sigurd does not release a blast of energy from the sword, instead drawing it out before throwing the sword as an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm.
“I thought it would be more effective if it was thrown,” he explains. The thrown sword hits the targets while wreathing the area in flame, and then Sigurd slams his fist into Gram with all his might.

The word bölverkr means “one who stirs up destruction and catastrophe.” In other words, another name of Sigurd’s forefather, Odin.
