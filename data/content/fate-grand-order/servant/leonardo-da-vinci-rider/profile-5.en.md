### Bond 5

#### Personality

It’s mostly the same as Da Vinci, but the little girl characteristic has a bit of influence. She speaks in a mild-mannered way, and her tone of voice is at times more girly.
Whenever she speaks to others, she no longer comes across as patronizing, like an all-knowing teacher, but rather more like a student who is eager to learn about the universe.
She’s like a little girl asking for you to read a book to her.

Unlike other Heroic Spirits, Da Vinci was a ball of curiosity and aspiration, even after becoming a Servant. Even if their dreams were of a dead person, they lived in the now.
Little Da Vinci was no exception. She continuously runs around trying to figure out what she can do to achieve the best results. Yet, she is dissatisfied and worried about how much her current self’s output has decreased.

Her anxiety shows when she often asks, “Am I doing as well as the former me?”
No matter how much she inherited all of the previous Da Vinci’s memories, none of those were actually experienced by Little Da Vinci.
That’s why she idolizes the original Da Vinci’s time spent with the staff at Chaldea.
At the same time, she yearns for something similar to herself. She feels a sense of responsibility, and a mission of hers is to accomplish something she can be proud of.
