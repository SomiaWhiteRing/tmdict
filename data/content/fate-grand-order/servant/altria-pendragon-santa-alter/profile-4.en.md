Sword of Promised Victory
A sword that shines with a dark aura.
Nothing else changes. 
Also, because its name doesn’t change, it’s different than a certain Servant from Halloween. 
This sword is completely unnecessary for someone like Santa Claus, but since there will be monsters during Christmas by some sort of mistake, it’s good to keep around.
