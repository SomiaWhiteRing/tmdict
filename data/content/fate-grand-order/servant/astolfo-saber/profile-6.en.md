### Bond 5

It all started during the 2021 Christmas event. After Astolfo took the wish-granting device, the Holy Grail (bell), from Nightingale, their subconscious desire to become a Saber was inadvertently granted.

But once Nightingale obtained the Holy Grail, Astolfo lost the power of a Saber. Feeling sorry for Astolfo, Nightingale turned them back to a Saber, and thus Astolfo Saber was officially born. Perhaps not surprisingly, the first thing Astolfo wanted to do the moment they turned back into a Saber was to shout the following to Master:

“I am your sword!”

They really wanted to say that with their head held high as a Saber. Yeah…that’s pretty much their entire motivation for becoming a Saber in the first place.
