### Clear Main Quest 「Return of the Wolf King」

After months of trying and failing to capture Lobo, who by then had come to be feared as the devil incarnate, the pasture owners hired Seton, who had the idea of using Lobo’s wife, the white wolf Blanca.
Blanca’s fierce curiosity led her into a tiger trap, where she was swiftly killed.
Lobo was finally caught when he came for his wife’s body.
However, he refused to eat any food from his captors, and died shortly thereafter.
