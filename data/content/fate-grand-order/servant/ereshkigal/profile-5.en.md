### Bond 5

She has a passive and introverted personality.
Her great pride and intellect cause her to sacrifice every part of herself to her duties as the goddess of death and decay.
She is jealous of all things beautiful, laughs at things that are ugly, and kills the things she desires in order to prevent others from laying claim to them.
â€¦That was the original Ereshkigal, but after she fused with the girl who became her vessel, she came to admit that all such tendencies were embarrassing and inappropriate, and so she swept her brutal nature under the rug.
However, since she is still very impulsive, she turns back into the terrifying (and disappointing) goddess of myth whenever she gets angry.
This behavior is entirely Ereshkigal, so she may seem both cooler-headed and yet more self-deprecating than the girl who is serving as her vessel.

She may sound a lot like Ishtar, but she also talks like an elegant lady at times.
Whenever she inadvertently acts meekly or goes into a panic, she may overexaggerate and pepper her speech with unnecessary adjectives, but that is a remnant of her original, polite nature. Ishtar, who should have been raised to be prim and proper, talks like a bit of a brat since she was so spoiled and raised as a carefree child. On the other hand, Ereshkigal, who spent her entire life working hard in the underworld, picked up the mannerisms and speech of a cherished (read: sheltered) noblewoman.
