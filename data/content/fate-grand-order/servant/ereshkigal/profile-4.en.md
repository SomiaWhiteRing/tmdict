### Bond 4

#### Magic Resistance: D

Nullifies any magecraft that is ranked D and under.
Being in the dreary environment of the underworld for so long has made death an everyday thing, substantially lowering Ereshkigal’s Magic Resistance.

#### The Secret Great Crown: A

A divine crown said to have been created from the treasure taken away from Ishtar.
As they are like Heaven and Earth, and two sides of the same coin, Ereshkigal possesses the same Authorities as Ishtar, but they have been altered to have somewhat dark (read: gloomy) effects.

#### Mana Burst (Cage): A+

Ereshkigal is serious, hardworking, and a bit of a melancholy goddess.
At every opportunity, she stores magical energy in her spear-cages, and she uses it during battle.

#### Blessing of Kur: EX

One of Ereshkigal’s Authorities, granted to her as the ruler and pillar of the underworld.
As she governed the underworld until the very end, she became the underworld, and it protected its queen.
It supports all of her allies, and also alters the performance of her Noble Phantasm.
