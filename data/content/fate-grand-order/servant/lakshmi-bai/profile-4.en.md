### Bond 4

#### Charisma of Rani: B+

A skill of the high charisma necessary to command an army.
This skill demonstrates the queen’s prowess as a military commander as she brought together the princely state of Jhansi to rebel against the British army.
Rani means “queen” in Hindi.

#### Sipahi’s Assault: B

A skill that represents a group of Indian mercenaries hired by the East India Company called the Sipahi, also known as Sepoy, who were said to be the cause of the rebellion.
The rebellion by the Jhansi princely state was triggered due in part to the Sipahi in Jhansi, who killed a stationed British soldier in response to the rebellion troops laying siege to Delhi.
Soon after, the Sipahi headed to Delhi, which left Lakshmi to spend her own money to hire soldiers to protect Jhansi alone.
