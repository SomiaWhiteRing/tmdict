Gouging Piercing Spear of Carnage.
A homing demonic spear missile.
Cú Chulainn’s original Noble Phantasm.
In his Alter state, he can throw it with such force that it is capable of destroying his own body, in exchange for damage and area of effect to be increased.
It can inflict Death on all enemies, and even enemies with Death resistance will suffer large amounts of damage.
(Since he uses rune spells to restore his destroyed body as he throws it, Cú Chulainn does not take any damage…as long as you don’t count the unbelievable pain.)
