### Bond 3

The altered and twisted form of Cú Chulainn, summoned by Queen Medb’s wish.
He reigned as the Mad King and brought chaos upon the land of America.

This is not what his berserker form is supposed to be in life, nor how he is supposed to be when summoned as a Berserker.
When receiving the backup from the Holy Grail, his power surpasses his Lancer or Caster form.
