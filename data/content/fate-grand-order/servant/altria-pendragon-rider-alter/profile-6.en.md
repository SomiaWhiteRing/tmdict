### Bond 5

Nero may think that all teams are the competition, but there is no team that stands out as needing special attention or effort in Alter’s eyes.
Nero and Alter… They may not get along, but Nero is racing for the action and entertainment, while Altria is racing to exorcise her violent tendencies (stress), and of course for the reward. The two combined forces to participate in the Ishtar Cup.

She has no intention of investigating the hidden truth behind the race.
Since she believes that she is the one being cheered on by the main character, she is always in a good mood.
Granted, you wouldn’t know that to look at her.

Their racing principle is to give it their all and hold nothing back.
Nero keeps flooring it without thinking of the consequences, while Alter keeps using nitro even when she’s actually thinking of the consequences.
Nero aims for beauty and speed, while Alter pursues simplicity and speed. The first bit doesn’t really match up for them, but since they agree on that second part, the two actually get along very well.
…Maybe this really is a miraculous team.
