Sword of Unwearying Burning.
A Noble Phantasm that combines King Arthur’s short sword (only to be used during a fight to the death) Secace, and Excalibur.

Secace may look like a small automatic pistol, but combining it with Excalibur turns it into a large sniper rifle, and it eradicates the unclean enemy before it can even approach her lord.
It looks like an anti-materiel rifle, but if you don’t want that pretty little face of yours to be blown away, it’s best you don’t point that out.
