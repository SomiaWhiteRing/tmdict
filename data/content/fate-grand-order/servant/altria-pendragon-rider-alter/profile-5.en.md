### Bond 5

(Even though she never mentions it, and indeed never even notices…) Alter changed into a swimsuit on a summer whim.
“I am absolutely not one of those stereotypical Swimsuit Heroic Spirits. Why? Because I am a maid first, a Heroic Spirit in a swimsuit second.”
Uh-huh. There’s certainly no response to such sound reasoning…
However, an already rigid personality has become even more strict after she became a maid. She has turned into a demonic maid who will not tolerate any debauchery from her Master.

She has joined the Ishtar Cup with Nero.
The team name “Tyrannical Shooting Star” was her idea.
A name fit for a near-miracle team with a renowned and egotistical emperor and a tyrannical maid joining forces.

Her reason for participating in the race is to prove her supremacy. A (tangible) reward is obviously expected, but then again, she believes that all is well as long as it’s for Master’s sake.
