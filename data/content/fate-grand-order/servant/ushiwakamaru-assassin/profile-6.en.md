### Bond 5

She’s…a bit immature and mischievous, but the clear thinking and almost inhuman rationality at Ushiwakamaru’s core remain intact. Because she is closer to a tengu now, her attitude of, “I’m a tengu, so I’m stronger than humans,” gives her a sense of superiority (not that she rubs it in, she’s just matter-of-fact about it). Part of why this version of Ushiwakamaru is so mischievous is because she can’t help but think, “I need to punish (teach) those humans who don’t realize what fools they are! (Haughty laugh)” Looks like she puts herself on a bit of a pedestal compared to humans.

“That human really is incorrigible. Okay, I’m going to make right by mocking them.”

However, she shows no mercy for those who commit evil deeds such as murder. “They don’t deserve punishment. I simply have to cut them to ribbons.”
