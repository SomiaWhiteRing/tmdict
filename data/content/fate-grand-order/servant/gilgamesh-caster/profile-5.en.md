Signal Cannon of the King.
A long-range bombing from the Uruk fortress. This amazing artillery strike uses not only the power of Gilgamesh, but of all the citizens of Uruk who lived during the Age of Gods.

Gilgamesh (reluctantly) loads his collection onto the catapult and allows his soldiers to fire them.
“Broken Phantasm?
I did that over 4,000 years ago!”
