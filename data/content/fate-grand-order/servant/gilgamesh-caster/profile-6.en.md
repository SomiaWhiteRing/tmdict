### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Return to Chaldea」

Humanity’s oldest King of Heroes, Gilgamesh himself.
His nature is different than when he is an Archer.
He is not a hero manifesting in a storm of power, but a wise king who leads his people.

“Fwahaha! It should be obvious if you look at my alignment!
I can overcome most any suffering and trials, but I refuse to die of overwork again!”

Since he’s watching his back much more than he was in the form of the King of Heroes, he has become more meticulous in battle.
