A section from the epic poem written by the famous poet Bai Juyi titled, “Chang hen ge (Song of Everlasting Sorrow)” that retold the story of the undying love between Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei. The “Rainbow Feathered Robe” passage was said to have been commissioned by Xuanzong for Yang Guifei. The poem was later forbidden for its symbolism of ruinous beauty, and its musical scores have been scattered and lost.

Yang Guifei became a Taoist nun before she was taken in as an imperial consort, and during that time she was trained under the Taoist Luo Gongyuan to ultimately gain the title “Taizhen.” Her soul became that of a sage after her death, and it is said that she continues to wait to reunite with her beloved emperor.

The star from the abyss chants a song that doesn’t reach the ears of the common people.
