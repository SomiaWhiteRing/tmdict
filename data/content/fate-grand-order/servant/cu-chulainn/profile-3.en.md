### Bond 3

#### Battle Continuation: A

Doesn’t know when to give up. He makes it possible to fight even with critical wounds, and survives unless given a fatal blow.

#### Disengage: C

The ability to escape from battle.
Because of these two skills, Cú Chulainn’s true value shines in group skirmishes over one-on-one duels. But he loves duels, so this fact doesn’t get noticed all too much.
