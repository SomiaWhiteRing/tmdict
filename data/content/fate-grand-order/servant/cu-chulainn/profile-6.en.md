### Clear Interlude 「The Taboo」

As an adult, Cú Chulainn joined the “Red Branch Knights” who protected the King of Ulster.
In order for him to marry the woman he loved, he was tasked to enter a place called the Land of Shadows.
Cú Chulainn overcame many obstacles to reach the Land of Shadows.
There the lord of the land, the witch Scáthach, took a fancy to him.
He trained under her to learn many spells and martial arts skills.
