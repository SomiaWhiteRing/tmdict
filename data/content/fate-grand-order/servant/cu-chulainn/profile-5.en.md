### Bond 5

As a child, he grew up with the name Setanta.
Cú Chulainn means “the Hound of Culann.”
When he was young, Setanta accidentally killed the watchdog of a wealthy merchant named Culann.
The name stems from the vow he made to the merchant:
“If this dog has a child, I will raise it, and turn it into a faithful watchdog.
Until then, I will make sure to protect you.”
