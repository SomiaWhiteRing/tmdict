### Bond 5

Ivan the Terrible is the tsar ruling the hypothetical version of Russia within the Permafrost Empire, Anastasia. His realm has been pruned from Proper Human History, as it was deemed an unnecessary deviation and an interruption even to Parallel World Theory. He has returned as a Servant, but in the history of the Lostbelt, he is the very first Yaga. All who live within his empire are Yaga, but that is only because mere humans cannot survive the extreme environment.

This change, however, cost them all something that was important to them as humans.
