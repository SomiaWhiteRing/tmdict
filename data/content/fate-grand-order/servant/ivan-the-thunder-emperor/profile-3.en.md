### Bond 3

#### Mental Schism: A

During his reign as tsar, Ivan the Terrible established a centralized government, but at the same time, his rule was defined by terror.
In the mornings, he cloistered himself in a church so he could reflect upon his sins, while in the afternoons he reveled in torturing rebels. These conflicting saintly and villainous mindsets allow him to switch between two categories of alignment: Lawful and Chaotic.

#### Innocent Monster (Foreign): A

He asserted that he was like unto a god, and by persecuting any nobility that had privilege and power, he was able to bring his authority to the absolute peak. Regarded by the people of Russia as the unchallenged tsar, the people in Western Europe cowered in fear and called him “Ivan Grozny” (Ivan the Fearsome).
Here, having fused himself with a massive Demonic Beast that was itself considered the strongest of its time, he has become (or rather, been reduced to) a monstrous leviathan. Fitting for the ruler of the frozen empire of the Lostbelt Russia.

#### Emergency Prerogative: A

The power of absolute control for the Tsar that Ivan the Terrible sought in order to control the opposing aristocrats. His intense intimidation and the power of his presence reduces the stats and skill ranks of those who face him. An ordinary human would find it difficult to even look at him. However, anyone possessing Charisma ranked B or higher can negate the effect.
