### Clear Main Quest 「The Grand Duchess of the Beast Nation」

Ivan the Terrible from Proper Human History may have been depicted as a tyrant, but he had little to no association with magecraft. However, when the world threatened to freeze over in the Lostbelt, Ivan called upon mages to develop a technique that combined humans with Demonic Beasts in order to survive.

However, this choice was tantamount to creating an entirely new sort of creature, completely different from humans. With their mentality so thoroughly changed, they were deemed to be taking a doomed path of human history. A dead end. A world that must be pruned.

With their never-ending wails echoing in his ears, the Ivan the Terrible continues his pilgrimage, plagued by regret.
