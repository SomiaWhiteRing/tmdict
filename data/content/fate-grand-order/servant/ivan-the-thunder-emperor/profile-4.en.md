Black Dogs, Come Forth into My Dreams.
Also known as the Black Dog Corps. A Noble Phantasm created from Ivan the Terrible’s personal guards, the Oprichniki, which were established at the same time as his Emergency Prerogative. The Oprichniki, who served directly under Ivan the Terrible, reserved the right to confiscate land and property of the aristocrats.
The group dressed in all black and rode black horses bedecked in black harnesses. They hung severed dog heads about their horses’ necks and carried broom-shaped whips made from animal fur to hound and sweep away any who would betray the Tsar.
They once slept and ate together under a single roof like a community…but they no longer exist.
They now dwell in the Demonic Beast Tsar’s dreams and serve as an automatic defense mechanism, a dominating Noble Phantasm force that is invoked the moment Ivan goes to sleep. The Noble Phantasm splits into multiple soldiers and runs amok, killing any who defy or otherwise wrong the Tsar.
As a group, their violence and power are overwhelming, but individually they are weak, which may be their only flaw. Still, each individual is still nearly as powerful as a low-ranked Servant when within the capital, Moscow.

Beast, Follow My Path.
A Divine Beast’s procession, one that the Tsar believes will eventually lead him to the heavens. Anyone and anything that may block his way must be in rebellion against the Tsar, and therefore in defiance of God’s will. Ivan the Terrible temporarily reclaims his mountainous form to mercilessly pulverize his enemy.
