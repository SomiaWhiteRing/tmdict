### Bond 3

#### Heartbreak: A+

Oni Magifender, Heart-Crushing Killer.
With her class changed, her Noble Phantasm meant to rip her victim’s bones out, “Bone Collector (One Hundred Furiously Blossoming Flowers - Wo Ai Ni), has become a skill. It is a terrifying skill in which she thrusts her hand into her target’s chest if they fail a resistance save, and then mercilessly crushes the heart and other vital organs.

It’s a Magifender Girl ability that was bestowed upon her to let her control oni… At least that’s supposed to be the official line. When a dubious member of Chaldea’s staff pointed out that any living thing would shut right up when someone crushes its heart, Shuten-Douji just giggled and said not a word.
