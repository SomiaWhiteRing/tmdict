A vicious pummeling attack carried out by relying on her tough physique and the natural strength that comes with being with an oni, all combined with her innate flexibility and cruelty. She begins with rapid punches and kicks that happen so quickly she might be thought to be teleporting around. While she may not have a long reach, evading her is all but impossible.  Even the protection afforded by Divinity is sure to be useless against such a savage attack. Her target is all but certain to die on the spot.

After the flurry of blows ceases, she may then launch the same poisonous alcohol-filled gourd from her Noble Phantasm, “Multicolored Poison - Shinpen Kidoku.” According to Shuten, she just does that for fun, though, so this particular Noble Phantasm is more a combination of furious blows.
