### Clear Main Quest 「EP 11: Victory! The End of Oniland!」

Inside, she is no different from her usual self, but…she consciously tries not to break character from the Magifender Girl image that Ibaraki clings to…at least as much as possible…

It’s probably more accurate to say that she continues to play along because she feels like she’s performing a sacred Shinto dance, Kagura, and she’s enjoying herself. It seems like she plans to remain in this form until it bores her.

Oh, also her familiar, Haku, was in actuality an evil dragon that appeared in The Kamuy’s Gold… The Haku we see now though is one that Shuten molded after the image of the original with her own magical energy. She says he doesn’t talk, but there may or may not be reports of Haku talking to himself when she’s not around.
