Cursed Cupid Cleanser.
BB once wielded a Noble Phantasm called the Cursed Cutting Crater: Spiritron Virtual Trap, but “I used that thing way too much and I’m sick of it. The theme for this event is cute and curing! Oh, but just because I’m on everyone’s side this time around, I’m not taking back the ’cursed’ section. BB’s curse is eternal!”
And that’s pretty much how she just made up a bunch of junk for a new move.

She draws out the power of the Mooncell to change into an invincible nurse’s outfit. From there, she pulls out malignant information from within her Void Space and overwrites the surrounding channels (common recognition memory) into a chaotic mess.
She rolls out the Reality Marble “BB Channel, Travel Ver.” and beats everything into a melting pot of chaos. At least that’s what she claims, but really she just changes into Nurse BB and pokes the enemy with a syringe.
