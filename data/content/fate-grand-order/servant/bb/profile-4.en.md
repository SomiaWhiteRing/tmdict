### Bond 4

#### Domina Cornam: EX→D

A super cheating skill on par to a god’s Authority.
Domina Cornam, or Ten Crowns, refer to the ten evil kings, while the seven hills point to the loathsome evil city.
In simple terms, it’s a skill that can make any injury or event outcome as if it had not happened.
As long as she has this skill, BB is virtually invincible.
Just kidding. That’s all in the past.
You know, an invincibility cheat is just shameful.
This is a skill unnecessary for the beautiful and cute BB this time around☆ Oh, but you can use it a little bit. See, like this!

#### Self-Modification: EX

A skill that modifies the self.
Within the Mooncell’s AI, there’s a cardinal rule that forbids the improvement of one’s functions.
But BB escaped such constraints after she broke down, and began expanding her own functions. To upgrade her calculatory abilities, she used her black static to capture and analyze NPCs, AIs, and even Servants and used them to expand her memory.
Ignoring the risk of self-destruction, she expanded by adding more and more to herself. As a result, BB turned into an ultra-grade AI with an expansive volume. She is like a city built on a landfill that continues to add buildings even while sinking into the sea, or perhaps Frankenstein’s monster.
