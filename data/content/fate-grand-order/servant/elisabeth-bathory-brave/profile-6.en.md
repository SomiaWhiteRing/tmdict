### Clear Main Quest 「Section 15 “Trick or Treat!”」

She fights with the legendary blade Eighteen, and the legendary shield Retronia, obtained when she became a Saber. 
But since she’s never practiced using a sword, she just swings them around.
She believes that she’s bound to her Master by a strong friendship that not even a civilization-destroying sword, a theater, or the curse of a fox could break.
(For this reason, she doesn’t really realize that she’s a Servant.)

Sometimes she thinks to herself, “Maybe I’m not a hero, I’m just a sexy female warrior. Maybe the real heroes are the little puppies/fawns…”

But she tells herself that even if that’s true, that’s not so bad either. An optimist, and true hero.
