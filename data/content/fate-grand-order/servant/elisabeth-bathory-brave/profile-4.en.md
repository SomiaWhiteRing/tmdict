Cyclone Demoness of Fresh Blood.
The Saber version of Báthory Erzsébet.
This forbidden technique seals away an enemy with her tempestuous hero power, and then releases a high-speed spin strike that causes them to explode. Of course, “hero power” here means Elisabeth’s sonic breath.  
This superthunder screw slash, launched at an enemy stunned both physically and mentally by Elisabeth’s supersonic waves, is strong enough to shatter evil talent agencies.
