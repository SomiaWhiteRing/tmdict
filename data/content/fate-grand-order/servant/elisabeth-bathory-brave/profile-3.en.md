### Bond 3

#### Double Class: E

A bizarre mutation, created by the fusion of a Lancer and Caster.
However, this doesn’t offer any real benefits. 

#### Mana Burst (Courage): D

A mana burst, but a rare type that releases internally.  
Increases defense. Strangely, it doesn’t make her happy at all.
