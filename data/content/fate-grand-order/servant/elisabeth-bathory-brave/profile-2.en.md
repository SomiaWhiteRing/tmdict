### Bond 2

Being chosen as a hero has weakened the wicked and bipolar aspects of her nature, and though selfish, Elisabeth has become a brave girl who saves the weak and outwits the strong.
Perhaps under the impression that being a Saber means being the good guy, she seems to believe that she’s in the position of a hero, and is trying her best to live up to the role, in her own way.
But since she’s not used to being a good guy, she screws up more than usual.
