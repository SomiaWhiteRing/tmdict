### Clear Interlude 「Pharaoh’s Shining Glory」

His attitude toward his Master changes with his mood. Should he find them to possess some degree of regality, he may elect to spend time with them…once in a while.
Of course, should his Master resemble a dear friend (a saint), he may show a much keener interest.
But…and this is very important to note…
While his sworn friend is Moses, his greatest love will always be Nefertari. Nothing could ever change this, not even to the end of time.
