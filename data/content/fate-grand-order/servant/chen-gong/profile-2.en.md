Spare parts left over from the creation of God Force…a micro magical circuit accelerator that is noticed by no one…
This is Chen Gong’s heretical Noble Phantasm that temporarily super-enhances allies with super-increased ATK and super-increased maximum output.
It sacrifices one of his own men to inflict damage to the enemy. In short, it’s Stella using someone else’s life. It is the worst.

“My strongest shall face the enemy’s strongest. What would be left is the skirmish between weaker soldiers.
The strategy for such a battle will be simple…”

Chen Gong often says such chilling things as he looks down on the scattered enemy lines caused by the generals’ explosive clash.

Because his tactics leave such a terrible impression on others, he uses a magecraft bamboo scroll from the ancient Xia Dynasty to cast an illusion that makes observers believe he shot some sort of powerful arrow that caused the enemy front to explode.
