### Bond 3

A sadist that would even put Lu Bu to shame.
He may look scholarly, but he’s aggressive. He suppresses any fear he has with reason and logic on the battlefield, and maintains an ironclad focus by putting up a gallant front.
He is a valiant soldier and a coldhearted tactician, stubborn and steadfast in his beliefs.
He has the ability to fight squarely, but he considers betrayal and sneak attacks as obvious strategies if it means he can win.

While he takes in others’ opinions and input, he rejects them all by saying he does not agree, then thoroughly crushes any opposition. The way he does not consider others’ feelings must make him look like an inhuman machine.

He is a talented military strategist, but he was first a master with the bow and arrow. But bows and arrows alone cannot pave the way to domination. Concluding that an individual’s military power is limited, Chen Gong abandoned the bow and studied military strategy.
However, his premature assumption was crushed the moment he saw Lu Bu’s attempt at domination through nothing more than an individual’s military power. From then on, Chen Gong remained beside Lu Bu.
