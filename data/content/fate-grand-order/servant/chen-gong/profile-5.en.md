### Bond 5

Chen Gong’s unknown birth has made it so that, in the world of Fate, he is a descendant of China’s oldest civilization, the Xia Dynasty, where he is an engineer who inherited all the literature and techniques of the Dynasty.
Yet, the Xia Dynasty’s weapons are not something a mere human can handle. They cannot be handled unless Mystics (that is, magical circuits) are inside one’s body, and Chen Gong initially mocked it as useless knowledge. However, when he saw Lu Bu emanating intense lightning from his whole body, he knew he found a fitting target, and he began working on developing a Chinese-style gadget. As Lu Bu was starting to get tormented by his uncontrollable ardor, the weapons that Chen Gong prepared for him worked well, with the added benefit of helping him control his anger. This led Lu Bu to trust Chen Gong even more.
