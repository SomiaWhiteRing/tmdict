### Clear Main Quest 「Women of Agartha」

At the conclusion of some modern day versions of “One Thousand and One Nights,” it is said that Scheherazade ultimately bore three children, and the king learned to have a tolerant heart. As stated above, this ending was not present in the original, so there is a high probability that THIS Scheherazade did not have such a happy ending. And yet, that ending continues to be passed down, which means…

Just like the one at the center of the rainbow that smashed through the phantasmal city…

There must have been someone who prayed for her salvation.

Someone who knew how she could be saved.
