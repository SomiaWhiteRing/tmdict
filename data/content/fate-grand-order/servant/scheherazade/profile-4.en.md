One Thousand and One Nights.
Possesses increased power against kings due to its origin.
Even if the target is not technically a king, she may consider them a king if she finds them to be sufficiently similar in nature.

This is a Reality Marble under the guise of a tale that she tells. By strongly asserting that her tale is indeed the truth, it becomes reality.
The characters, props, and spirits that appear within the One Thousand and One Nights’ stories can be summoned.
Even characters and stories that were added on by later generations like Aladdin and Ali Baba, which did not exist in the original version of One Thousand and One Nights, contribute to her existence as a Heroic Spirit and thus can be used. The accuracy of attribution is not important in terms of her ability to use her Noble Phantasm, as its purpose was to entertain the king. This Noble Phantasm’s tale always ends with:

“…is how the story goes.”
