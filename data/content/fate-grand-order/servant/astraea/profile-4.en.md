### Bond 4

#### Blessing of the Scale: A+

A skill based on the Divine Spirit Astraea’s Authority. This skill deploys an impenetrable defense mechanism against targets awaiting judgment, as the scales that symbolize Astraea are embedded within her body. However, her vessel’s wishes have transformed it into a skill intended for hand-to-hand combat. In other words, the professional wrestler will never fall.

#### Star’s Judgment: A

Under the Authority of the stars, all targets who are to be tried, humans on Earth and even Divine Spirits, are forced to accept their judgment.
