### Bond 2

She originates from one of the three Horae Sisters in Greek mythology and is said to have been a daughter of Zeus and Themis, but there are few accounts of this to be found in Greek myth. Legend has it that during the Iron Age, while many gods left Earth as evil ran rampant, she was one of the few who stayed behind until the very end and tirelessly appealed to humanityâ€™s sense of justice. The story of her scales later becoming Libra and she herself becoming Virgo garner only brief mention. However, in later ages, she and her mother Themis (with whom she is sometimes conflated), and Justitia from Roman mythology were given a different name and attendant significance. Namely, Lady Justice, or the goddess of justice. She is often seen depicted in statue form as a lady wielding a sword and scales and frequently appears in front of courthouses and law offices.
