### Bond 5

#### Melt Virus: EX

Special abilities that the Alter Egos inherently possess called an id_es.
A cheat skill that evolved from the Skill “Drain.”
The ultimate energy drain. It combines draining, copying, and scaling down all into a single skill.
Drain can be used for both organic and inorganic materials as long as they are physical. However, intangible things, such as thoughts or skills can only be synthesized, but cannot be converted into something usable for her, and so are only turned into basic nutrients.
As a result, the only things Meltryllis can really make use of are EXP points and mass.

#### Neurological Disorder:

Meltryllis’s sense of touch is degraded, particularly in her hands. More specifically, she has almost no sensation at all in her fingers. This has led her to be active in trying to interact with the outside world.
Her sadistic “hobby” was likely born from her thinking that “I can’t sense the presence of others by myself.”
