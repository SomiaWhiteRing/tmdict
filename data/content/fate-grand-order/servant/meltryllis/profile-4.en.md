### Bond 4

#### High Servant: A

An artificial Servant synthesized from multiple mythological beings. Possesses the essences of Artemis, Leviathan, and Sarasvati.

#### Sadistic Nature: A

A skill that increases aggression during battle. It may sound like a positive skill, but the longer the battle draws out, the more her sadism increases, and she loses her composure.

#### Crime Ballet: A

Simply put, it’s a battle style.
Numerous attack skills that Meltryllis adjusted herself, based on her obsession with classic ballet.
Meltryllis was originally an Alter Ego created from BB’s emotions of “desire to be served” and “pleasure,” and her true nature was meant to be a lovely but sickly girl whom men feel compelled to protect. It’s assumed that her obsession with ballet comes from that image, but her skill that continuously drains others’ abilities likely resulted in her current combative personality.
