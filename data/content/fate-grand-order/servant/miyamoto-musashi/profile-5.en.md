### Bond 5

#### Emptiness: A

The highest level a swordsman can attain. The ultimate mental state.
Corresponds to Suigetsu of Yagyu Shinkageryu.
To become nothingness makes her invincible. Only a swordsman who has reached the infinite mental state can achieve this.

#### The Book of Five Rings:

A book written by Musashi just before her death, detailing the techniques she had mastered in life and the mental states she had achieved. It is divided into five books: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void, and is the culmination of everything that is Musashi.
The Book of Earth serves as a general introduction to the Niten Ichiryu. The Book of Water introduces specific techniques. The Book of Fire speaks of the art of war in terms of strategy and tactics. The Book of Wind discusses the flaws with certain tactics and techniques, so that a fundamental understanding of Niten Ichiryu will appear of its own volition in the reader’s mind.
The final Book of the Void contains Musashi’s understanding of the concept of emptiness, written as a technique called “contrast.”
