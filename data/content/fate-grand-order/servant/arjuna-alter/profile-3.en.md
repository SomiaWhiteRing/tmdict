### Bond 3

#### Madness Enhancement: EX

He resolved to rid himself of all evil to begin a new age. But in exchange, he’s lost almost all of his human qualities. As his Spirit Origin changes, his Madness Enhancement also fluctuates.

#### Anti-Evil (Unique): EX

The equivalent of those who have the Authority to bring about the end. The skill shoulders the duty to eliminate various evils. Because it’s highly virtuous, this skill affects almost everyone other than innocent children or saints.

#### Clairvoyance (Transcendent): EX

Clairvoyance that transcends the limits of a human being. In a sense, it can be said that this is the ultimate form of sight, differing from that of Mystic Eyes.

#### Soul’s Light: EX

The human spark and personality that Arjuna barely managed to protect and maintain. Its light will shine brighter by growing stronger along with his Master.
