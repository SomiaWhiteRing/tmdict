### Bond 2

In Indian mythology, thereâ€™s a hero who is extremely close to being a god who both ends and restarts everything. And now this Lostbelt Servant, Arjuna (Alter), inherited the Authority of destruction from this hero. He lost almost all of his human qualities in exchange for this power, but his innate nature as a hero prevented him from becoming completely mechanical.

As his relationships with the gods were severed and he is now summoned as a Heroic Spirit, he will begin to slowly regain his original human nature as his Ascensions progress.
