### Bond 2

Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by Nimue the fairy of the lake hence the nickname “Knight of the Lake.” After coming of age, he headed to the island of Britain, and became a Knight of the Round Table after meeting King Arthur. They say he was unparalleled in his bravery and chivalry.
