### Bond 5

The demonic blade Móralltach, so powerful that it seemingly commands even fate, was given to Diarmuid by Manannán, the Celtic god of the sea and the otherworld. Manannán also bestowed the Noble Phantasm Fragarach to the sun deity Lugh, and was known to possess and give away many other Noble Phantasms.

Once its True Name is revealed, Diarmuid executes a superhuman leap at his enemy. At that moment, Móralltach takes a guise similar to that in the legend of “Manannán’s Legs,” becoming a triple blade to dispatch Diarmuid’s enemies.
