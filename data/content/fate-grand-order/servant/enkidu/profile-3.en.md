### Bond 3

Enkiduâ€™s combat power is equal to that of the Hero King Gilgamesh at his peak.
In the battle recorded in the Epic, they proved a match for Gilgamesh, one of the strongest heroes of human history.

The solitary King Gilgamesh found his first friend in Enkidu, and they regarded Gilgamesh as their only friend.
After their battle at Uruk, the two went on many adventures together, but in the end, Enkidu died after the fight against the divine beast Gugalanna.
