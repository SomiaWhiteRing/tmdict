O Humans, Let Us Restrain The Gods.
Enkidu turns their own body into a single divine weapon. Incredible amounts of energy are transformed into chains and Enkidu uses them to pierce and bind the target.

Enkidu was originally a weapon sent by the gods to return Gilgamesh to their side.
Gilgamesh was the Wedge of the Heavens, created so that man and the gods could never be split apart.
When he rebelled against the gods, it was Enkidu’s job to bind him and bring him back to heaven.

But Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s friend. The Chain of the Heavens was used for the benefit of mankind just as his friend wished.
