### Bond 4

Introverted, active, and strong-willed.
Normally Enkidu resembles a peaceful flower, but once provoked, they become a terrifying monster that shows neither restraint nor mercy.

They view humans favorably, as they are among the life on Earth. However, since humansâ€™ sapience leads to their separation from nature, Enkidu does not see protecting humans as a priority.
Instead, Enkidu feels closest to plants and animals, and so primarily acts to protect them.

That said, Enkidu has always been intensely curious (a demand for intellectual stimulation), and demonstrates joy when conversing with humans.
If an individual has a personality they find pleasing (filled with love for all things, a universalist, while still putting their own needs first) they will show deep respect and appreciation, and find joy in helping them.
