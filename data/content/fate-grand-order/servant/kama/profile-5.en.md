### Bond 5

#### Ananga: EX

A skill referring to Kama’s other name, it means “one without a body.”

There once was a demonic god named Tāraka who wreaked havoc among the gods. Eventually, the gods learned that only the offspring of Shiva and Pārvatī could defeat Tāraka, but Shiva was deep in meditation, and was in no state to give Pārvatī any marital attention. Desperate, the gods dispatched Kama to shoot Shiva with the arrow of desire to revitalize the couple’s love. However, Kama’s actions enraged Shiva and he opened his Third Eye to incinerate Kama.

When Shiva, the god of destruction, unleashed his power and reduced Kama’s physical body to ash, what became of the divinity’s essence?
