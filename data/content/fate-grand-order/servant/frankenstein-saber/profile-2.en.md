### Bond 2

The summer heat has turned Saber Fran lazy. But she does seem to go out of control when things get desperate…hahaha, either way, she’s such a handful…hahaha.

She’s like a big dog, lethargic in the summer heat.

And the old man encourages her out-of-control behavior.
The only person we can count on is Professor Babbage!
With a team that combines steam, lightning, and wicked plans, nothing can stop them… Maybe!

Oh, by the by, she ended up turning into a Saber after fiddling around with her Spirit Origin.
