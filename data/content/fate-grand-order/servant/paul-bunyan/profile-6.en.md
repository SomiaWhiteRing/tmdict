### Clear 「Epilogue: Master Returns to the Cafeteria」

Paul Bunyan may be mere legend, but her delightful tales are still passed down in present times…known by a great many, even a hundred years later.

Even if they aren’t historically accurate, even if they are utter nonsense, legends passed down from person to person will be beloved for all time by people everywhere.

Hopefully she understands that.
