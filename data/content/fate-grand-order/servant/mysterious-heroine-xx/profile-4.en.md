### Bond 4

#### Suit Up: EX

The protection of the sacred spear armor Aahvalon. The armor constantly exists around XX in the form of spiritrons. With a speed of negative one second (where it can turn back time by one second to activate even if XX is taken by surprise) it protects and arms XX. She calls this little stunt “Suiting Up.”

…Don’t kid yourself, missy. This is actually an astonishing skill that XX acquired because she habitually overslept and was late for everything, even after joining the Galactic Police. It could actually be called a quick change skill. In fact, there’s no real need for it, and it functions as armor in its spiritron state just fine. Arming oneself significantly increases their attack.

#### Police Instincts: E

Divine revelation used to find culprits. The low rank suggests it’s really not so great for solving crimes, though. Various hints to solving crime seem to stem from otherworldly inspiration completely devoid of logic. XX never really notices these hints though. In some cases, this demerit becomes advantageous, actually making this a brilliant skill.
