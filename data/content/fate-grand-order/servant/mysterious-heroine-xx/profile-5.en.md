### Bond 5

To sum up Mysterious Heroine X in a sentence would probably be simplest by saying that she is the protagonist of a TV comedy. By inheriting Altria’s serious demeanor, X focuses on doing everything as quickly and simply as possible. Contrary to her polite and energetic mannerisms, she is extremely competitive (since she’s not really aware of this, she is unbelievably dense). She challenged herself to achieve various things, and was absolutely relentless, not giving up until she succeeded. This was a bit problematic, but since she possesses such a virtuous nature, she ended up working to benefit others, so it all worked out okay.

However…
With the Servant Universe full and boiling over with an excess of Extra Classes, the balance between heroes and villains collapsed. The moment the scales of space tilted toward the villains, XX vowed to change her principles… And then the show headed into a new season. As an unemployed X didn’t know what to do, she was hired by a secret society, the Galactic Police. In their HQ’s center. she stumbles onto the oldest artifact in space, the Rhongomyniad. Her talents are acknowledged, and she becomes active as a Galaxian.
