Mystic Sword Counter, Incoming!
The fantastical sword technique that Musashi, in her long life as a swordswoman, was said to have used only once.
As the recipient of the technique is no longer among the living, Musashi is the only person who knows what it looks like and what it does.
It’s a special Spirit Origin that thoroughly insults, vilifies, and smashes up swordsmen who have fallen into evil ways, heresy, or demons.
If its to be renamed, it would be an Anti-Swordsman Anti-Swordmaster Grand Bounded Field, Ganryu-jima.
By becoming a Berserker, an intelligent yet fiendish killing method like transforming the island into an full fortress for swordsmen and luring them to the middle to ultimately destroy them all, island and all, is no longer executed.
Instead, five dynamic sword styles of earth, water, fire, wind, and sky call forth a large amount of seawater to create a water pillar and surround the enemy, turning into a soaring sword that splits the enemy using the water pillar.
