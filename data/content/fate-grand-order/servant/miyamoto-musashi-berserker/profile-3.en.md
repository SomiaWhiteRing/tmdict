### Bond 3

#### Magic Resistance: C

As she turned into a Berserker who swiftly and skillfully slices through various evils, its rank has gone down.

#### Madness Enhancement: EX

She’s become quite strange, perhaps because of summer.

#### Riding Skill: D

She rides her jet ski to head off to Ganryu-jima. She doesn’t think there’s an issue with Musashi being like that.

#### Divinity: D

“Musashi…are you eating the food offerings from the altar?”
“Ehehehe…” (An embarrassed laugh that exposes her staggering stupidity).
