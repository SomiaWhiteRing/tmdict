The miraculous single hit emitted by over-boosting the super MAKOTO DRIVE engine installed in the jetpack.
Extreme jet acceleration beyond the physical limitations of any person causes the three-stage thrust to execute at sublight speed, which results in its velocity consuming the surrounding air and induces an outrageous power output that swallows up and annihilates the target’s surroundings, despite it being a single target attack.
Due to the over-the-limit load it puts on the user, it can cause incapacitation at random.

#### 『Makoto In Summer Flag』

The lighthearted version of Saber Okita Souji’s Noble Phantasm.
In order to exterminate the outlaw ronin rampaging amidst the summer sea, numerous warriors from the Shinsengumi, who all have the wrong idea, are summoned.
The basis for this Noble Phantasm can only be used by a Saber-class, and so the Assassin-class Okita cannot use this.
So when CAN this Noble Phantasm be used, then?
