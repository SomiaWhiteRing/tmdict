### Bond 3

Asclepius learned the art of medicine and hunting from Chiron, and ultimately began to show more talent in medicine than his teacher. His talents led him to create medicine capable of bringing the dead back to life by using the blood of Gorgon, provided to him by Athena.
However, the medication made it so that humans were able to evade death, which meant that there would be no need for the Underworld. Hades, the god of the Underworld, asked Zeus to do something about this crisis, as Hades could not directly intervene with Asclepius due to his heritage as Apollo’s son. And so Zeus killed Asclepius with a thunderbolt.

To quell Apollo’s anger, Zeus raised the dead Asclepius as the constellation Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer.
