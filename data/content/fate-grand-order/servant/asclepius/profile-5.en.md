Imitation Medicine, The Obsolete Underworld’s Moan.
The medicine of Asclepius’s creation that is capable of reviving the dead.
…At least that’s what it’s supposed to be, but this Noble Phantasm is not quite it, but instead imitates its effects. The resurrection medicine in the past used special, unique ingredients, and so even though he was summoned as a Heroic Spirit, the materials could not be automatically procured for the Noble Phantasm. Therefore, during normal Holy Grail Wars, this imitation revival medication is used.
Because it’s an imitation, it is notably less effective than the original, and various conditions must be met to actually revive the dead, including restrictions on the condition of the corpse and how long it has been dead.
Using knowledge he gained from the modern world, he calls it a “glorified AED,” in a self-depreciating way.
Additionally, this imitation medication is quite precious in itself, so it can’t be used multiple times.
