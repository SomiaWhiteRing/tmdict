Perish Within My Rage, Ye Hero.
Her vengeful hatred for Achilles, her warrior spirit striving for strength, and War God Ares’ bloodline…all of these things are roused in her fury, and she purposefully transforms into a beast, a true Berserker who has lost all sense of reason.
She charges forward, screaming “Achilles!!!” even if the target is not Achilles, as she can think of nothing else. She attacks with everything she has, whether with weapons or barehanded, and in the end, finishes everything by biting like a beast.
An anti-Achilles ultimate kill move.
