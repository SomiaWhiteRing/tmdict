### Bond 2

#### Mystic Eyes of Death Perception: A

The most unique special ability of all, the Mystic Eyes.
Even for Mystic Eyes, this is the rarest of the rare.
Regardless if the target is organic or inorganic, the eyes can perceive the “concept of death,” and recognize it as a phenomenon that can be interfered with.

The world seen from the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception is filled with “lines of death.” Even with a completely healthy psyche, it is difficult to live with the consistent sight of eventual death.
Normally, Shiki would shift her focus and try to overlook the world in order to compromise for this abnormal sight.
