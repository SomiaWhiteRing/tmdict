### Bond 4

#### Curse (Dakini Spell): EX

A spell to either acquire social status and wealth (for males,) or love from those in power (for females.)
Allows the user to attain power, and even realize one’s own time of death.
But since Tamamo was traumatized in the past, she doesn’t really want to use this skill.
