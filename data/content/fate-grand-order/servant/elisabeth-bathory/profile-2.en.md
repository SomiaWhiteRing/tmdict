### Bond 2

She is an evil Anti-Hero, but also a young girl longing for romance.
Because she is timid at heart, things sometimes backfire, and she ends up rescuing allies or letting enemies go.
She acts good enough that it could be said, “Well, I guess you can kind of call her a Heroic Spirit?”
She actually dislikes being told, “You’re actually a good person, aren’t you?”
