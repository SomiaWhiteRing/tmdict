### Bond 5

#### Projection: C (Conditionally A+)

A type of Magecraft that can recreate any item momentarily.
Archer favors “Kanshou and Bakuya” which are also created by Projection.
The rank drastically increases if the projected item is of the “Sword” category.
Because he has the trait of “creating as many counterfeits as possible,” Emiya tends to destroy or detonate the recreated Noble Phantasms to increase their firepower.
