### Bond 2

She’s the usual Altria, but she’s a bit more relaxed since she’s at the beach. She still feels like she’s a leader, but it’s obvious that she’s calmer than usual.
She thinks it’s a good idea to let loose, given that she’s on vacation.
Work hard, play hard.
Whether it be sports or games, as she hates to lose, she’ll always aim for the seat of strongest of the Archer-class.
