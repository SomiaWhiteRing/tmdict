The Blinding Flash of a Demonic Shield.
A demonic shield owned by the evil mage Atlante, who once abducted her love, Ruggiero. With its True Name revealed, the shield emits a powerful burst of magical energy, forcing the target to faint while sustaining damage. Even if the target does not faint, the shield’s magical light drastically diminishes their agility.
It bears mentioning that she does not primarily strike with a shield. Perhaps it is because she’s just so excited to be manifesting at all, she just unconsciously charges forward to bash her targets. It is said that when Bradamante defeated Atlante, she took the shield that he held, and she gained the Phantasmal Hippogriff. (Should she be summoned as a Rider-class, Hippogriff would come with her.)
