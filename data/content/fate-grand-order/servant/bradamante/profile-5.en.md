The Lovely Princess’s Ring.
A ring of magecraft possessed by Angelica, the beautiful princess of a foreign nation, who enthralled Roland, one of the Twelve Paladins, as well as Rinaldo, Bradamante’s older brother. It is said that the ring can nullify various effects created through magecraft. Bradamante obtained this ring under dire circumstances, and used its power to rescue her love Ruggiero from the evil mage Atlante.

Her Magical Resistance skill is ranked A due to this Noble Phantasm; Normally, it would be ranked C. Additionally, it grants her the Magecraft Removal skill.

Should its True Name be revealed, the entire party would gain tremendous protection from magecraft, but its True Name is not generally revealed in this game. The Noble Phantasm also possesses the power of invisibility, but that is not so commonly used. During her manifestation, the ring’s magical energy is imbued in her spear, which appears to raise its combat power against anything magical.
