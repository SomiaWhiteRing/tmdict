Mechanical Illusionary Method: Bull Swallowing  
Creates a vacuum blade to suck up the target, crushing and compressing the enemy. This is the application of the illusionary technique of swallowing a cow as described in “Kitakoshi Gundan.”
Using the Mystic Code Kashin Koji personally incorporated, this Noble Phantasm possesses a characteristic that allows it to specialize in demonic attacks.
It is possible to use this illusionary technique to cause something to vanish right in front of one’s eyes or to make something reappear as is described in tales, but it is not used this way in FGO.
