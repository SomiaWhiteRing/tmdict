### Clear 「A More Human Heart」

For a time, Danzo acted as a sort of foster parent to a certain red-haired child during her stay at Fuuma Village. As she retained the first Fuuma Kotarou’s skills within her memory, she became the ultimate teacher of the Fuuma technique. Sometimes she taught the child the way of the ninja, and others she doted upon him as if she were his mother. This child was none other than the boy who would eventually become the fifth Fuuma Kotarou.
