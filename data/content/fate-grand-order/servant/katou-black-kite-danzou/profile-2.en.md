### Bond 2

One legend says that Katou Danzo utilized puppets and marionettes, but this legend derived from the fact that Danzo was a puppet herself. At least, thatâ€™s how it goes in FGO.

She was a ninja in the Fuuma tradition who was active during the end of the Warring States period.
In truth, though, she is a puppet created by a necromancer named Kashin Koji. She was a man-made kunoichi, created with the cooperation of the first Fuuma Kotarou. She was never a truly living human being. In spite of that, she was able to fulfill many duties and was mentioned in various records, which led her to leaving a mark as a Heroic Spirit in human history.
