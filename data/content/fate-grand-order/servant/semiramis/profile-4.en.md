### Bond 4

#### Presence Concealment: C+

Once she goes on the offensive, however, this skill’s rank drops sharply.
However, this limitation does not apply when she is slipping poison into something.

#### Territory Creation: EX

A mage’s ability to create territory in which they are empowered.
By gathering physical materials, her gardens surpass even a temple.

#### Double Summon: B
