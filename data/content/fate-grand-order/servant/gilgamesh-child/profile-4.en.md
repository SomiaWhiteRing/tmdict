The Omniscient Omnipotent Star.
This Noble Phantasm is the ascended form of the King of Heroes’ strong will, one that allowed him to travel across all corners of the world and witness every phenomenon.
It’s the type of Noble Phantasm that’s always active.
In this game, the only Noble Phantasm he releases the True Name for is the “Gate of Babylon.”
