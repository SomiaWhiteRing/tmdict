### Bond 2

A samurai who has maintained his “makoto” and fought throughout the ages by taking off his pale blue haori and replacing it with Western clothes and wielding a gun.
He may be a Berserker, but he can converse normally.
In contrast to his brutish fighting style, he is quite rational on the battlefield, and he shows flexibility by using anything that might lead to victory.
If the Master who summoned him gives up on fighting, that Master will immediately be annihilated.
