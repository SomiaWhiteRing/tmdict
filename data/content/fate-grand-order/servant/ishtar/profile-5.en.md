### Bond 5

Her primary weapon is the airship and giant bow “Maanna, the Boat of Heaven.”
Maanna is the ship of the gods in Mesopotamian myth, and also the interstellar gate that connects Earth and Venus, but because she is a Pseudo-Servant, the warp function is normally locked away.
Ishtar can also use a spear, but this time she is 100% an Archer.
While she says she’s a Mesopotamian god, she seems closer to an invader from the second planet from the sun.
