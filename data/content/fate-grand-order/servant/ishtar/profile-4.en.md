### Bond 4

#### Mana Burst (Gem): A+

She enhances her weapon with her incredible magical energy and uses it to increase her attack power.
Normally, Ishtar’s divine aura could be used for almost any purpose, but perhaps because of the body she’s inhabiting, she can only store magical energy in gems.
It’s a powerful mana burst skill, but since the energy must be stored in a gem before it can be used, it can be a little difficult to figure out when to use it.

#### Manifestation of Beauty: EX→B

As a goddess of beauty, she has a fearsome amount of charisma. Even as a Pseudo-Servant, her personal magnetism far exceeds human capabilities.
While originally a composite skill (gauge absorption, curse, skill-sealing) centered around seduction, due to the strong preferences of the human she’s possessing, the enemy debuff effects have been removed, in effect making it a standard charisma skill.
(Originally EX rank, currently downgraded to B.)
