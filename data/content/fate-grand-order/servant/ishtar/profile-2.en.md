### Bond 2

Her name in Sumerian mythology was Inanna, which is the older of her names. Ishtar is her Akkadian name.
She is the goddess of Venus, as well as the goddess of fertility who brings prosperity to humanity.
Also a goddess of war and destruction, she once sent a terrifying divine beast called The Bull of Heaven into the city of Uruk. She’s just a terrible nuisance of a goddess.

She was also famous for having many lovers, and would go after anyone she decided she liked, be they human or god.
On the other hand, she was as cruel as the embodiment of evil to anyone who didn’t do what she wanted.
It’s said that the reason she sent the Bull of Heaven to Earth was because the Hero King, Gilgamesh, did not succumb to her temptations.
