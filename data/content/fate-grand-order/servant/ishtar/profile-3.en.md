Kindling of Venus that Shook the Mountains.
The most destructive and cruelest of Ishtar’s deeds in Sumerian mythology.
A Noble Phantasm created from the story of how she defeated and slew Mt. Ebih, which even the king of the gods feared and respected, simply because, “I didn’t like it.”
According to Mesopotamian myth, Ishtar went up the mountain, and her mighty power grew with each step.
When she reached the peak, she grabbed hold of it, and then thrust her spear into the mountain’s heart, destroying the entire Mt. Ebih range.

Based on this myth, when she uses her Noble Phantasm, she warps to Venus, then uses her Authority to fit the concept of the planet within her hand. She then stores this conceptual planet into Maanna, and fires it.
This attack demonstrates that she shows no fear, not even of the gods. Another name for this attack is Jabal Hamrin Breaker.
