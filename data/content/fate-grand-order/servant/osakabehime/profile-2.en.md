### Bond 2

She may look like a black-haired, prim and proper maiden, but on closer inspection, one can see she is a gloomy, listless, and naturally lazy girl. She may act like a princess, but because her communication skills are frankly abysmal, she tends to just behave according to whatever tropes she knows offhand.
If you ask her whether she’s malicious or not, she’ll say she is, but she’s really just playing at being a little devil. At worst, she’ll max out your credit card.
