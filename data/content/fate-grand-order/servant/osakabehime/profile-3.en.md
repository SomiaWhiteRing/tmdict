### Bond 3

#### Chiyogami Technique: EX

She can manipulate origami at will. She uses this technique to create decoys of various shapes that combine attack, defense, and transformation.

#### Morph: A+

She took many forms whenever she appeared before humans, such as a seventeen or eighteen-year-old woman wearing a twelve-layered ceremonial robe, or a fierce god about three meters tall.
It’s not the flashiest skill out there, but she’s one of Japan’s very best transformers.

#### Castle Apparition: A++

The collective name for creatures who moved from a shrine to a castle. It has even been said that Osakabehime is the true master of Himeji Castle.
According to myth, merely seeing her will put a curse upon you…or even result in instant death!
On the other hand, she gets pretty weak if she sets foot outside her castle.
