Hakurojyo no Hyakki Hachitendou-sama.
A powerful magecraft that manifests a miniature version of Himeji Castle. This magecraft is superficially similar to a Reality Marble.
Making use of her famed beauty and dignity, she provides mental support to her embattled allies. Were Osakabehime a more aggressive sort, she could easily turn the castle into a terrifying weapon. Thanks to her being a complete and total shut-in, though, it pretty firmly remained in the realm of defensive Noble Phantasms.
