Beloved White Bull.
A continuously active Noble Phantasm. The white bull whose form Zeus took as his avatar…or at least something closely resembling it. This Noble Phantasm was a gift from Zeus to Europa to protect her, and initially it appeared as a hound, just like in the myth. However Europa was heard to say, “I’d rather have it look like you. It would look so lovely, and it would be a perfect pillow.” After she said this, it changed form.

It constantly protects Europa when she rides on its back, and is capable of traveling anywhere, even over the surface of the sea. This Noble Phantasm is the very reason Europa manifested as a Rider. The moment its True Name is revealed, it should be able to gallantly run through enemy territory, but its True Name will not be revealed in this game.

As a side note, the skill “The King of Gods’ White Bull” has been assigned thanks to this Noble Phantasm.
