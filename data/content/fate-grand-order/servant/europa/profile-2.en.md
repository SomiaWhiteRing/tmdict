### Bond 2

A gentle and compassionate princess. She’s carefree, unassuming, good-natured, and she doesn’t dwell on the small details. Her typical reactions to most things are to smile warmly, to be spaced out, or look sleepy. She does not flinch even if Divine Beasts or giants appear before her, and she didn’t even panic when she was kidnapped by the king of gods. One can only conclude that she is either naturally ditzy or that she carries herself with dignity appropriate to a consort of a god…

A fellow goddess and divine consort once remarked, “She probably doesn’t even have a grasp of reality.” And yet Europa simply smiled when she heard that.
