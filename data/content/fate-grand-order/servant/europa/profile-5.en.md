The Bronze Giant’s Super Massive Hammer.
Another Noble Phantasm that was gifted by Zeus. It’s the bronze monster Tálos, an autonomous machine from the Age of Gods. This incredible weapon was crafted by none other than Hephaestus, one of the twelve gods of Olympus, and it was bestowed upon Europa by Zeus himself. The Noble Phantasm’s sole and ultimate purpose is to protect Europa at all costs. Its durability is remarkable, and not even the gods can readily destroy it. While originally not a giant, but a monster, the fact that it was frequently mistaken for the Colossus of Rhodes has caused it to take the shape of a giant we see today.

It automatically detects and annihilates enemies. When it gets angry, its limbs become red-hot as it lunges at the target, and any ordinary creature would disintegrate in an instant on contact. In this game, the giant is summoned every time it’s needed for attack, or when its True Name is revealed. It then detects its enemies and instantly flies into a rage. Its scorching hot iron fist hammers down into enemy territory.

Long ago, on the Island of Crete, Europa often rode on Tálos’s shoulders for fun, but this was very troubling for Tálos since it heats up whenever it gets angry. Please come down, my mistress. Tálos doesn’t like the witch Medea. During the Age of Gods, she managed to attack its weakpoint—the heel—and the blood of the gods, known as ichor, which was also its source for magical energy, spilled out and immobilized it.
