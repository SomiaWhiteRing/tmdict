### Bond 3

To Kiara, she is the only true human, and all other people are simply beasts and insects that take human form.
Because she believes this, she may appear to project her love to the outside world, but in truth it is a self-serving display. 

The lives around her exist for her pleasure and, as the sexual deviant that she is, she feels that the consumption and destruction of others’ lives is the ultimate erotic bliss.
Her sole desire is to achieve this ecstasy. The consent and safety of others is not a factor. She is perfectly delighted to experience human lives coming to an end within her own body.
Kiara observes it all, and smiles while she basks in the sheer delights it offers. She is like a Bodhisattva kindly watching over a human life.
…As to the victims of her wicked decadence, though it leads them ever closer to their own destruction, they surely experience pure, celestial ecstasy.
