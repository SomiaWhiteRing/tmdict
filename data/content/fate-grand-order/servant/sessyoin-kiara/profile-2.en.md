### Bond 2

She is introverted and timid, yet energetic.
She is a woman of graceful elegance, but she is not straightlaced.
She has the capricious mind and sophistication to enjoy any jest. She has a warm and tender personality.
Though her manner of speech and viewpoints are modest, her words are sometimes sultry in tone. She is mild-mannered but active. She may look frail, but she is sprightly. She has a gentle soul, and is deeply merciful.
She sees into the heart of things, understands the feelings of others, and has the thoughtfulness to empathize with people’s beliefs and suffering.

…However.
The truth of the woman lies in her blind, narcissistic pursuit of pleasure. She is the emancipated Devilish Bodhisattva.
She is a tender sadist and a powerful masochist.
She claims to love humans from the bottom of her heart, but she speaks of morality only so far as it serves her. She extolls the dignity of life only so far as it serves her. She protects the world only so far as it serves her. Truly, she is a narcissistic monster.
