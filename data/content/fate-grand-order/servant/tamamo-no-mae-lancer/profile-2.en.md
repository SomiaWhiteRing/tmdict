### Bond 2

Hereâ€™s some background.
Tamamo-no-Mae was a spellcasting shrine maiden with the desire to be a good wife.
She was an unparalleled beauty that served Emperor Toba at the end of the Heian period.
It is said her true identity was that of the Nine Tailed Demon Fox, and as a Heroic Spirit, a part of her is the reincarnation of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.
Despite her impressive background, she thinks it might not be bad to spend her life vacationing on a tropical island.
