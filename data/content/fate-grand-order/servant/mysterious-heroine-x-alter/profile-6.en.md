### Clear 「XXXX. Mysterious Heroines」

A synthetic Servant who was molded through forbidden magecraft by extracting the X gene from Mysterious Heroine X. She instinctively tries to rid herself of Heroine X, but she is unaware that her reason for doing so is the self-loathing and self-destructive tendencies of an Alter.

The impulses that make her tend to go out of control may be held in check by a good Master.
