### Bond 5

Foreign blood flows in Kotarou’s veins, as does the blood of oni. Due to the Fuuma Clan’s breeding programs, the ultimate ninja who can survive the harsh conditions of the Warring States was born.
He was born a chief, a ninja, and someone who would lead the Fuuma Clan to its prime.

…However, Kotarou is kind and gentle by nature. Although his body is that of an ultimate ninja, his personality is not fit to be one. It is said he spent most of his time in his own room.
