### Bond 2

A girl who has never known the sensation of pain because her sense of touch is numbed, a condition called analgesia.
Since she does not understand what pain is, she is unable to sympathize with othersâ€™ feelings and has always been an outcast.
As Fujino was highly intelligent even in her youth, she pretended she did not have analgesia and insisted that she was an ordinary person in order to protect herself. However, she was lying to herself as well.
She is a Servant added in Revival: the Garden of sinners/the Garden of Order. She will never appear in the story, but she has joined the battle as a special guest.
