### Bond 3

#### Mystic Eyes of Distortion: EX

One of the most powerful forms of the unique special ability known as Mystic Eyes.
Even for Mystic Eyes, this is the rarest of the rare.
Regardless of whether the target is organic or inorganic, the eyes perceive any physical object as a photograph, which enables her to twist and rip them no matter how big or solid they might be.

#### Remaining Sense of Pain: A

The pain of death that continues to repeat over and over, even though it’s been healed. Proof of being human. In order to seal the girl’s special ability, the Asagami clan restrained her sense of touch.

#### Independent Action: A+

Not that she prefers to be alone, but she has a bad habit of wandering off on her own. Effective for stalking. It’s likely strenuous on her because she would run low on magical energy, but since her sense of pain is diminished, she just doesn’t realize it.
