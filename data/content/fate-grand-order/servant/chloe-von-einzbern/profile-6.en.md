### Clear Main Quest 「epilog: The Windflower Blooming in the Breeze」

Illya’s sealed memories and personality fused and differentiated, forming an individual personality called Chloe.
She is aware of this.
Aware that her existence in this world is a miracle.
It may not be in the form that she wanted.
Even so, Illya and the others accepted her.
The warmth of the family she thought had been stolen was definitely there.

To teach her little sister, to defeat her sister’s enemies, and to show her sister the way.
One day, that little sister will speed on ahead and become a shining, distant star.
