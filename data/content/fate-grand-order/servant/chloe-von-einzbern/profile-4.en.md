A special move used by a certain Heroic Spirit, it projects three pairs of married swords. Utilizing the paired swords’ attraction to each other, this series of ranged slashing attacks is practically unavoidable. When combined with Chloe’s ability to instantly move behind the enemy, this maneuver is difficult to perceive even with the Mind’s Eye skill. The only way to defeat it is to either defend from all directions, or ignore the damage and attack the user directly.
