### Bond 2

At first, Illya rejected Chloe, but after reconciliation, she began to reside with the Einzbern family.
They tell everyone they are cousins, but since their faces are so similar, people often take them for twins.
When Illya’s older stepbrother, Shirou, first met Chloe, he mistook her for Illya.
Although he can’t be blamed, since he didn’t know of Chloe’s existence, the fact that he could not tell them apart was quite a shock for Illya.
