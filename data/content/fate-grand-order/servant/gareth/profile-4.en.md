### Bond 4

#### Riding Skill: B

As an expert jouster, Gareth possesses the Riding skill typically not given to Lancers.

#### Gareth of the Beautiful Hands: B

When Gareth disguised herself and worked around the castle, Sir Kay nicknamed her “Beaumains” (Beautiful Hands) for her beautiful and fair appearance. At that time, Kay had no idea that it was Gareth.
In short, Gareth was fair-skinned, and her hands were especially beautiful.

#### Ring of Transformation: B

Gareth possesses a ring that is infused with magecraft used for disguises.
It’s originally a Noble Phantasm-grade effect, but it’s used as a skill in this game.
