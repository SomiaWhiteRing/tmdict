### Bond 3

Agravain wanted to expose Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot’s adultery and asked Gareth to act as a witness to set the scene.
However, in refusal, Gareth said, “I will not do anything outlandish to Sir Lancelot, who raised me to be the knight I am today,” leaving with a heavy heart.

Later, Sir Lancelot is caught in his adultery and Agravain is slain in retribution. Gareth is then ordered to be present for the captured Queen Guinevere’s execution. Gareth stated that she would only do so against her will, attending the execution without bearing any arms or armor. This decision ultimately brought tragedy.

Sir Lancelot comes to rescue the Queen and ends up crushing the unarmed Gareth’s head.
Many lives were lost in this single incident.
Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth…
Sir Gawain’s sorrow from losing his siblings must have been immense.
Thus, the Round Table is sundered, and the glory of King Arthur and the Round Table meets its end.
