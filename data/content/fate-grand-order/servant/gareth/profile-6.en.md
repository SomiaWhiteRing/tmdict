### Bond 5

The tragic girl knight who has a heroic and puppy dog disposition.
Once she has come to idolize someone, she will never betray them no matter what.
Even in death, as her former life shows.

She honors the way of the knight, believes in justice, and follows through on her beliefs.
She is proud to serve under the King of Knights, and she feels that being chosen as a member of the Round Table was the greatest honor in her entire life, even to this day.

She still admires Sir Lancelot. Even after the way she met her end on that fateful day, she respects him. Even when he never seemed to notice her as he single-mindedly charged to save Queen Guinevere, she idolizes him. And even if he had known, even if he had been aware of who he cut down without hesitationâ€¦she would adore him even still.
