### Bond 3

#### 『Napping in the Dazzling Sunshine and Feasting』

A variant of the “Eightfold Blessing of Amaterasu.”
Originally this Noble Phantasm was modeled after a torture game where humans were sent into a forest with a tiger, not for the humans to hunt the tiger, but the tiger to hunt the humans.
It seems like the meaning of “feasting” has been changed here.
