### Bond 5

He is likely to be difficult to deal with as a Caster-class Servant. That should, however, be both expected and understandable if you accept the fact that he would readily trample anyone in service of fulfilling his dream.

He was a sickly man during his lifetime, particularly prone to skin infections. In consequence, he was said to have been dour and pessimistic. His refusal to take off his mask and reveal his face reflects that particular quality. Historically, Avicebron is said to have passed down his philosophical teachings from Arabia to Europe. It may not even be a stretch to say that he was one of the first to begin the Renaissance.

He also coined the term Kabbalah, which is derived from the Hebrew word for “receive.” Legend has it that he created a female golem to do housework for him.
