### Bond 2

One night, while lounging in the bath, Illya was attacked by a magic wand that came from the night sky.
Wig-waggling and smooth-talking, the ultra-shady wand completely bamboozled her, and so here comes Magical Girl Prisma☆Illya, ready to fight evil and protect the innocent.
Of course, don’t tell anyone at school about this☆

…That night, she had an encounter with fate.
