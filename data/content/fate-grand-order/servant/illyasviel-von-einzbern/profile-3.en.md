### Bond 3

Winning over the strange wand, opening the heart of a shy girl, welcoming as family the girl who came to kill her… Even she doesn’t realize how high her adaptation and communication skills are.
An unkind person might say she tends to just go with the flow.
Her drifting has finally brought her to Chaldea, but even so, she still makes it work.
So long as she has her magic wand, the will to chase the future, and her sly cuteness, she will do just fine.
