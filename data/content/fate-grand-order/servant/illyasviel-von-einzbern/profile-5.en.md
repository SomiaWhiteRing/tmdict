### Bond 5

#### Suspicious Medicine: A

A mysterious potion refined by Ruby in the attic over several nights. It is certainly Amber Herb.
Comprised mainly of plant matter (poisonous plants).
Some say Ruby is growing the strange plants in the Einzbern householdâ€™s backyard, creating a psychedelic garden that would certainly get the authorities called if the wrong person saw it.
While scarily effective, its serious side effects mean that you should refrain from using it.
