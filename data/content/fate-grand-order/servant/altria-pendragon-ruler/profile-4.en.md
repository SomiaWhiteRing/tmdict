#### Knight of the Lion: B

It is said that a knight named Sir Ywain fought alongside a lion.
Thus, it’s no surprise that his liege, our king, is be able to command a lion of light.
Unless, when her Spirit Origin changed, our king may have personally chosen this skill originally designated for Sir Ywain.
…That may also have some truth to it.
