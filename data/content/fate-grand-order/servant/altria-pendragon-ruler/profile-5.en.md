Be Brilliant, My Shining Hall.
The highly mobile grand hall Ehangwen that sails over the water is temporarily materialized, and Ruler Altria, aka Summer Lion King, leaps up and shoots a giant ray of magical energy to attack all enemies.
It’s unclear whether the past Ehangwen had any sailing or artillery capabilities, but it appears that this is somehow nothing but a casual attempt, as it was made after she said, “It hasn’t been done…but there is no reason for it not to work.”
As for its artillery, rumor has it that it might be accomplished by concealing her Rhongomyniad, or even that it could be the same Noble Phantasm as when she’s a Lancer. The king does not deign to comment on either possibility.
