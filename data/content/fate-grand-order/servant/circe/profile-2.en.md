### Clear Main Quest 「Second Knot」

A famous witch who lived on the mythological island of Aeaea, Circe appears in Homer’s epic, “The Odyssey.”
As a descendant of Hecate, she is the demigod of the moon and love.
Being quite the science buff, she is well versed in mixing magical elixirs that can cause various effects and transformations.
Circe has a penchant for extending a warm welcome to the human men who visited her island and entertaining them with feasts, but then turning them into lions, wolves, pigs, and other animals as soon as she grows weary of them.
Her older brother is Aeëtes (Medea’s father, the King of Colchis) and her younger sister is Pasiphaë (mother of Asterios, wife of King Minos of Crete).
