### Bond 4

He’s just. Always. Angry.
He’s angry about the irrational. He’s angry about sadness. He’s angry about the arrogant. But, he vowed never to hate.
He constantly wishes to be someone that can object to an irrational world.
He simply ignores any intelligent rationale, and he can easily blow away anyone that leaves him wanting.
He’s the sort of Servant where compatibility with his Master is crucial if he were ever to get involved in a Holy Grail War. If he isn’t compatible with his Master, there’s a good chance of him just self-destructing in the first battle.
