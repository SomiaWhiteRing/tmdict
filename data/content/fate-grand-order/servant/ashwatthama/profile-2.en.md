### Bond 2

One of the heroes in the Mahabharata epic.
His father is Drona, the hero of the Brahmin.
During the great war mentioned in the epic, Aśvatthāman sided with Duryodhana just like his father, and fought fierce battles alongside Karna against the five Pandava brothers.
However, as many influential individuals from his own camp were killed, including Karna, Aśvatthāman, in a fit of rage, broke his oath as a soldier and carried out a night raid.
It was said that he massacred thousands.
