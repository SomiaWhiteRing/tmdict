### Bond 4

Medb is said to be the mother of many warriors, but she doesn’t actually give birth to them.
After taking the genetic information of a warrior, she replicates the information inside her body.
Then by pricking her index finger with a blade and letting a drop of blood fall to the ground, her blood becomes a large pool where the warriors are “produced.”
In the most literal sense, she is the queen and ruler of nameless soldiers.
