### Bond 2

Innocent and pure. Wicked and lustful.
Both are her true nature, and neither is a lie.
It just so happens that the majority of peopleâ€™s impression of her is the former.
She purely devotes herself to endless lust, and does her wicked deeds with endless innocence. She loves good men. She really loves strong men!
In life, she never once went against her own desires, and made many men her own.
Fergus, the owner of the sword Caladbolg, was one of her lovers. She also loves treasure, and for that reason she started a war against the entirety of Ulster, riding on a chariot and leading the forces of Connacht into battle.
