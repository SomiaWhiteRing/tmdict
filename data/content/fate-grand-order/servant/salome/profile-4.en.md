### Bond 4

The scene “John the Immerser’s head plated on a dish and offered to the young girl” offered vivid inspiration to the artists that came afterward, and multiple religious works of art came out between the Renaissance and Baroque periods.
Through these works of art, numerous speculations on Salome’s motives were made.

In the 19th century, French novelist Gustave Flaubert’s short story titled “Hérodias” gave the cause of the incident as the ambition of Herodias, who feared John’s influential power, and that Salome was merely an accomplice to the incident.
Later, Oscar Wilde released a play titled “Salome” in 1893, which was later adapted into an opera by Richard Strauss. It was from this that the terrifying image of Salome falling in love with Jokanaan (John) and seeking his head became notorious.
