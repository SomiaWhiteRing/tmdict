### Bond 4

#### Schwarzwald Falke: B

German. Translates to “Black Forest Falcon.” It’s not really of any actual significance. Jeanne just thinks it sounds cool. Ah, the power of the bizarre…

#### Fallen Witch: A+

An altered form of Jeanne’s “Dragon Witch” skill resulting from her change from Avenger-class.

#### Meurs Où Tu Dois: EX

The full name is: “Va où tu peux, meurs où tu dois.” It’s a French proverb that means, “Go where you want, die where you must.” No matter what she says and does, Avenger Jeanne is always seeking a place to die, and it cannot be a comfortable or gentle death… No matter how desperate or intense, what she ultimately wants is a satisfying ending, and so she keeps fighting.
