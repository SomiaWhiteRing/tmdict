The Burning Laws of Nature, A Massacring Dragon.
Everything she does and all the names she gives her abilities are the opposite of Jeanne d’Arc in order to counter her. If Jeanne is the sea, Alter will be the mountains. If Jeanne is water, then Alter will be fire. Leveraging her power as a former Dragon Witch, she summons something reminiscent of a black dragon to spread disaster. And don’t bother asking why it’s German.
