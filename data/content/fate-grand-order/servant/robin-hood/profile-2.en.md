### Bond 2

Doesnâ€™t care about his methods of winning.
Specializes in ambushes, sneak attacks, and poison arrows.
Frivolous, cynical, and snarky, but has a good heart.
Somewhat timid, he acts insincere to hide the fact that he is naive yet just.
He is a lot like Emiya, which is why they dislike each other.
