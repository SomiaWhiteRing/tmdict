### Bond 5

This Heroic Spirit is adept at assassinations and sabotage, and is well-versed in natural poisons as well. Since Yew is said to be a tree that leads to the underworld, the Yew Bow has the power to instantly amplify all toxins (such as poisons and illness) that the target carries.
If the target has been poisoned, it can detonate the poison like gunpowder.
