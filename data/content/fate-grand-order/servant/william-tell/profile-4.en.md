### Bond 4

#### Aiming: EX

A skill that represents the ability to aim projectile weapons. It can even hit an apple placed atop one’s son.
In addition to extreme concentration that can control even the user’s breathing and heartbeat, the ability to unconsciously synchronize with the outside world enables the user to naturally achieve the desired result of striking his target, rather than merely firing at a target with the intent of hitting it.
This is also the spiritual nature of Eastern archery as well.
