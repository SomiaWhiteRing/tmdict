### Bond 2

Just like his portrayal in the play, he is a brave man who stands up against tyrants who torture citizens. However, his actions were not intended to address a national or political crisis, but rather were undertaken for personal reasons.
He simply acted as was expected of any hunter, father, and man, which eventually led him to become a just man. In short, he became a larger-than-life hero.
He is a man who wholly embodies the concept of a patriarchal hero, where he possesses both the boldness and composure necessary to protect his family. He can be thoughtless one moment or affectionate the next, and he is frightening if angered.
