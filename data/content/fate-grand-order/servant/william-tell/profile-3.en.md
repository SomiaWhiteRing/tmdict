### Bond 3

The story of William Tell is famous, but the stories after he saved his son are not as well-known.

When Tell was ordered to shoot the apple with a bolt, the evil Vogt Gessler knew that Tell concealed a second bolt other than the one he set on his crossbow. After Tell expertly hit the apple and saved his son’s life, Gessler asked why Tell hid a second bolt. Tell responded, “If my first bolt hit something other than the apple, my second bolt was meant to kill you.” This enraged Gessler and he arrested Tell, but Tell managed to escape en route to imprisonment.

And so…in order to escape from the Vogt’s revenge and to protect his sons from the Vogt’s wrath, Tell did the only thing he could and was expected to do: he ambushed Gessler on horseback and shot a bolt through Gessler’s heart.

With the tyrant gone, peace was restored to the town, and Tell was lauded as a hero. And through this incident, Switzerland’s movement for independence gained even more steam.
