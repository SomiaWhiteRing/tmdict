### Bond 2

Originally, she was a low-ranking god called Nalakuvara in Hindu mythology. She became known in China as a Buddhist guardian god, and was ultimately added to Taoist teachings as the child god Prince Nezha. She is still worshipped and known mainly around China and Eastern Asian regions to this day.
Nezha appears as a key character in the “Investiture of the Gods.”
In “Journey to the West,” she appears in order to subdue Sun Wukong (who was running amok in the Heavens) and is also sent by the Lord of Heaven multiple times to help Monk Sanzang’s party throughout their journey.
