### Clear Interlude 「The Feudists」

As it happens, Taiyi Zhenren was quite nonchalant about assigning a gender to his creation, so Nezha was actually treated like a child who had yet to reach puberty.
This means that Nezha’s body, post-resurrection, does not share the gender she had in her past life…and it’s too late to do anything now.
Nezha is proud of her body’s origin and functions, but the moment the topic of her gender is brought up, she becomes awkward and uncomfortable.
