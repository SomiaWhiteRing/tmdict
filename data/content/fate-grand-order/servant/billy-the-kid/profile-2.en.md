### Bond 2

His outlaw life started at the age of 12, when he stabbed a man who insulted his mother.
After that, he served as a wagon train guard while doing robberies and cattle thievery on the side.
Heâ€™s the type who would often get into trouble with other outlaws for simply being on the street. But even so, he always keeps his smile and tries to avoid trouble as much as he can.
