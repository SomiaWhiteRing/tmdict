### Bond 3

#### Eau de Toilette White Honey: B

A hypnotic scent of sweet honey that seems to be carried on a breathy sigh. Even if she stands still, a single waft of this aroma can manipulate a target’s parameters. Any target unable to defend itself magically (such as normal humans or animals) immediately becomes a willing puppet. A young boy can turn into a brave soldier on par with a seasoned warrior, while a seasoned warrior can be turned into a meek young boy.

Even a Servant’s parameters can be altered if they have no way of resisting. It’s somewhat similar to the skill “Intoxicating Aroma of Fruits.” She acts as if putting on perfume when using this skill, so it may not activate if she’s interrupted. However, is there anyone on earth who would could possibly stop her from doing what she wishes the first place?
