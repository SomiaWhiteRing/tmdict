### Bond 4

According to the traditional Japanese play “The Tale of Ushi Gozen”…

A child conceived by the Ox-King
Gozu-Tenno was born into the household of Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka.
This child, cursed as the offspring of an oni, was sent to a temple to be raised in secret.

At the age of 15, the cursed child took the name “Ushi Gozen” and created a demonic territory in Suzunomori, Shinagawa.
The samurai who went forth to eliminate this menace was none other than the elder child of Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka,
Minamoto-no-Raikou, alongside the Four Heavenly Kings.

“Ushi Gozen” was the reincarnation of Gozu-Tenno, and Gozu-Tenno was the reincarnation of Indra.

…Just who was Ushi Gozen?
And what was the outcome of that fated battle?
Only Minamoto-no-Raikou and Sakata Kintoki know the answer.
