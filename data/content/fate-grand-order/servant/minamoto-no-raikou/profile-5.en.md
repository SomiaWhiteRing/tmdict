### Bond 5

#### Madness Enhancement: EX

A skill that increases physical abilities in exchange for the user’s sanity.
In Raikou’s case, she retains her sanity and stays as an intelligent being. However, as her mind is being corrupted by a mix of oni blood and excessive maternal love, her moral values are corrupted as well.
(She will eliminate anything and everything for the sake of her love, and protect them obsessively.) 
She speaks of love, yet she will ignore all moral values, and do anything in the name of love. In other words, she’s mentally ill.
Not many people can perceive her broken side, which separates her from other Berserkers.
Basically, it’s impossible to ask her to change her mind.
