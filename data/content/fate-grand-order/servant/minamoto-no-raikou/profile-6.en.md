### Clear Interlude 「The Different Story of Ushi Gozen’s Home」

For Raikou, her Master is a single ray of light into the darkness of her heart.
Other than Kintoki, her Master is the only other person who accepted her demonic self and formed a contract with her.
For that very reason, she is extremely affectionate towards her Master.
However, as she’s very possessive, she will cry if ignored, and question her Master with a scary look if cheated on.
“Maternal love” sounds good, but too much of it will become “a total control over a child’s life, taking away their freedom and their future.”
Although Raikou’s love has reached the realm of madness, due to her high intellect and rationality, her madness is not widely known (to those around her, and to herself).
