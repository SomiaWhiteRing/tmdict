### Bond 3

Since the original Jeanne was not a hero but a saint, it’s impossible to summon her “alternative side.”
This dark saint’s core was mixed with Gilles de Rais’s anger, prejudice, and twisted wish of how his holy maiden should behave. As a result, this impossible side of Jeanne was created.
The Dragon Witch who swore vengeance on France.
Perhaps this is the ideal holy maiden for Gilles de Rais - one who despises people’s hypocritical words of justice, and hates the fools who blindly follow those words.
