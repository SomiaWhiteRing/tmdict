Normally she treats her Master harshly, but since she’s created from the image of the saint Jeanne d’Arc, ultimately she feels some sort of admiration towards her Master.

According to a certain Avenger-class Servant, “in her subconscious, she wants to start an Avenger gang where she’s surrounded by many handsome guys that match her preferences.”
