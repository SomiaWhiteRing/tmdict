### Bond 5

#### Jacob’s Limbs: B

An ancient fighting style passed down from Jacob, to Moses, and finally to Martha. If mastered, one can even win against an Archangel. Legend says that a saint who mastered this style would destroy the “Angel of Death” who led a legion of 12,000 angels. Martha’s demeanor after releasing her Noble Phantasm’s True Name is because of this skill.
