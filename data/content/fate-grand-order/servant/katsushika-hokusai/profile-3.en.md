Fugaku Sanjuurokkei.
“The Great Wave of Kanagawa”, one of Hokusai’s best-known works of art, is the 21st piece in an ukiyo-e series.
By brilliantly capturing nature’s movement in his godlike brush strokes, this work of art almost takes on a mysterious life of its own. All who lay eyes upon it feel the excitement and energy of the crashing waves.
Through his communication with the evil god of the Abyss, he has awoken to a talent out of this world. Making the madness his own, he created the ukiyo-e “The Twisted Wave of Kanagawa.” This artwork combines the thirty-six views of “Primary Fuji” with the ten views of “Reverse Fuji,” and treads further still, into a realm that’s forbidden to any human.
