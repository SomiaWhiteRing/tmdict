### Bond 5

The Elemental, or creature, called Viy does not really exist. It is a fictional monster from the horror novella “Viy” by Nikolai Gogol, one of Russia’s preeminent literary figures. However, there are many Slavic folk tales of spirits closely resembling Viy, and it’s assumed that the story is based on them.

The version of Viy that has formed a contract with Anastasia is a familiar kept by the Romanov Dynasty. Using his Mystic Eyes, Viy could expose secrets, seek out a fortress’s weakness, and paint the walls with his enemies’ blood.

Without the necessary aptitude, one could not even see him, much less control him. It was only on the very brink of death that Anastasia earned the right to form a contract with him.
