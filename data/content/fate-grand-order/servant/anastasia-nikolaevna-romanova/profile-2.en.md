### Bond 2

While she is naturally innocent, she tends to behave in a rather aloof manner immediately after she is summoned, as she is rather mistrustful of others. After gaining her trust, her more mischievous side becomes apparent. There is even a rather cute record of her taking a photograph of herself while looking into a mirrorâ€¦a selfie, in the modern parlance. A few letters to her family survive today, providing a glimpse of her naivete and deep love for her family.
