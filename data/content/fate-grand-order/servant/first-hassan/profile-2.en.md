### Bond 2

It’s said that no member of the cult of assassins has ever laid eyes on him, but this is because to see him is to die.
The first “Old Man of the Mountain,” he chose the life of an observer, bringing judgment to ensure that the clan never fell to corruption. The cult acted in accordance with the teachings of God, but its deeds were undeniably evil. That was why he could not allow the cult to rot.
For those who defend the teachings of God to drown themselves in human desires would be an unforgivable blasphemy.
