### Bond 5

#### Presence Concealment: A

The ability to conceal one’s presence, or rather, what remains of the skill he once had. This swordsman is afflicted with a powerful curse, and even if he perfectly succeeds in his concealed actions check, the person he is about to kill will detect him.

#### Evening Bell: EX

The evening bell is sounded to tell the people of funerals, and alert them to death’s coming.
This special skill was created as a result of his fusion with that ritual.
This swordsman does not choose for himself who he is to kill.
When his target loses sight of when they are to die, he offers them salvation in place of the Lord of Heaven. Everything he does is the will of heaven, and because of this, all who meet him know that their fate is at an end.
…Hearest thou the bell?
It tolls the end of thy fate.
Accept it and release thy soul. That is thy last chance to rest in peace as a human.
