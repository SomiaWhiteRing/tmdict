Steel Sky Demoness.
Mecha Eli-chan directs her full complement of artillery at a single person in the ultimate private concert. Normally, this is an Anti-Army NP, and it’s honestly a bit brutal that it’s all getting used on one person.

Although Mk.II vehemently denies it, her fundamental thought process is the same as Elisabeth Báthory’s.
Mk.II’s natural intellect and composed nature normally seals Elisa’s inherent power, but there is a chance her sealed inner nature may reveal itself when she goes berserk after reaching maximum output.
