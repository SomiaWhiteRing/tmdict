### Clear Main Quest 「Section 15: Final Explosion Coaster」

Mk.I, though merciless and good-natured at the same time, was unable to discern Osakabehime’s true intentions, and so fell in her estimation.

Mk.II, who did understand her goals and character, was not angered by either, but instead simply continued on being the coldhearted Servant who ruled over Castle Csejte and Halloween. 
To Mk.II, Osakabehime and Chaldea are the same.
They were outsiders, no more than tools who possessed the Holy Grail necessary to preserve her castle.

Unlike Mk.I, who was a copy of Elisabeth, Mk.II was based entirely on the guardian statue. She is essentially Castle Csejte’s defense mechanism.
Her main body is the superstructure (giant mecha) that appears behind Himeji Castle, but since it consumes so much magical energy, the only thing that properly works is her arms.

At first, she seemed to be the cold, cruel villain, but…you know how she ends up.
Ultimately, she’s still Elisabeth, which means she warms up to Master, who pays attention to her. And as usual, her (sub) heroine power is quite high.
