### Bond 3

A mild-mannered, honor-student type. Cultured, sensible, and gentle, she loves to read and write poems and stories that touch on the vivid and elegant literary potential of love. She is punctual as well, and keeps a rather true to life diary. Some of her favorite stories are “Taketorimonogatari” and “Isemonogatari.” In fact, it’s said that Murasaki Shikibu’s characterizations were influenced by “Taketorimonogatari,” while her wording, phrasing, and characters were heavily influenced by “Isemonogatari.” She also took inspiration from Bai Juyi’s poetry collections and biography, and it’s said that the lines Hikaru Genji used to seduce women were influenced by the Chinese supernatural stories of the Tang dynasty, “You Xian Ku.” Three poems, “Kokinshu,” “Gosenshu,” and “Shuuishu” stand among her very favorites, even among the many anthologies of poetry she read during her lifetime. She shows great interest in stories and poems from other ages and regions, and will take any opportunity to read more.
