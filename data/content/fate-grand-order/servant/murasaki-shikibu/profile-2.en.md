### Bond 2

She was the daughter of Fujiwara-no-Tametoki, a poet and scholar of Chinese classics. Her father’s family line included many renowned cultural icons (her great-grandfather, Fujiwara-no-Kanesuke, was a known poet who also penned the biography “Shoutokutaishi Denryaku,” and he was known as Tsutsumi Chunagon), and so it’s assumed that her lineage helped her surround herself with books and other writings. She married Fujiwara-no-Nobutaka, a titled court official, while she was in her twenties. The couple had a child, but as Nobutaka was much older than her, he died three years after they were married. As a young widow, Kaoruko began to write a story that autumn. That story became the great fifty-four chapter classic, “The Tale of Genji.”
