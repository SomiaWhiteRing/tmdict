### Bond 4

#### Great Poet’s Poem: A

According to chapter sixteen, titled “Nihonchoutekiji” in the “Taiheiki,” a man named Kinotomoo was dispatched to slay the rebel Fujiwara-no-Chikata, who had four oni subordinates. He banished the four oni by reading the following poem:
“All things, grass and trees/Are ruled under our great Lord/No oni at all/Have a place in this nation/They may ever call their home.”
Just like Kinotomoh, Murasaki Shikibu, as one of the chosen thirty-six imperial poets, can read poems that can banish evil oni.
One of her poems was also chosen to be a part of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu:
“Almost before/I had the chance to notice/it was there,/the late-night moon swiftly/slipped behind the clouds.”

#### Curse (Poem): D+

It appears Murasaki Shikibu delved some into the way of the onmyou and some elements of it are mentioned and appeared in the “Tale of Genji.”
In modern-day terms, she would be an author who educated herself in magecraft in order to write a novel that features magecraft.
