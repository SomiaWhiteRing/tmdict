### Bond 5

The intellectual body carved out of the primordial goddess herself.
A Divine Spirit who was reborn into a Servant in order to experience new things in Etherspace.
Space Ishtar is, at least in the Servant Universe, a goddess who actually existed and has taken up the most modern form.
Instead of being a goddess who rules Venus observed by Earthlings, she is the goddess of Venus that emerged from Venus’s ancient civilization, so she is definitely seen as an alien by Earthlings.

The Origin Universe refers to something that existed long before the Shining Blue Galaxy (Etherspace, now the Universe world) existed, a realm where humans really were humans. It is older than ancient space, and the goddess Ashtart had a cult of worship within prehistorical ancient civilizations, long before mammals existed on Earth.
These humans did not carry the notion of faith at that time, and so they considered goddesses simply to be a term for a sector that enabled life to exist.
Whether the belief itself or its practices took shape to become a concept is unclear. Either way, Ishtar/Ashtart became a galaxy taking the form of a human. Normally she would not be someone who could be handled by humans, nor would she have ever become a Servant.

But when Professor Tokiomi coincidently discovered the spiritual core of the goddess, he raised her as the “good half.” Even after his death, he left his daughter in the hands of a trusted assistant.
“I may only be able to teach the textbook definition of what’s good, but being the smart girl that she is, Space Ishtar’s likely to see through the hypocrisy of the teachings, and she may lose interest in good and ultimately fall to the side of evil if I’m not there for her.
However, by being close to Jane, who is genuinely good without being two-faced and is able to get to the truth of things (despite paying the price of calling forth destruction and chaos), Space Ishtar may realize that good and evil are not always two sides of the same coin. Hopefully she won’t fall to evil that easily.”
As the professor predicted, Space Ishtar grew up with a sound(?) mind and body, and did not fall to evil, instead training to become a superb straight man to Jane’s one-woman comedy act. Although she has a short fuse and is a bit stingy, she became a fierce bounty hunter who helps the weak and bites back at the strong.
Meanwhile, Jane didn’t change at all.
