The Crown that Shines in the Origin Universe.
An alien planet invasion Noble Phantasm that incinerates all, created by converting and releasing the energy of the galaxy’s Spirit Origin―a higher dimensional soul configured by summoning an ancient shrine called Bel Maanna said to be the proof of a goddess.
Unlike Ishtar, Space Ishtar does not ride her boat all the time.
What Space Ishtar does instead is rouse her shrine (the Baal shrine said to have been constructed by Anat) which has an aggressive and ominous form. At least that’s what has been described…

“Edin” means “grasslands” or “plains” in the Sumerian/Akkadian language, and it is said to be the word from which the Old Testament’s “Eden” is derived.
Shugurra is the crown in Edin, and it was given to Ishtar when she entered Edin.
Quasar is a modern day astronomical term, referring to a quasi-stellar object. Its enormous observed radiant energy, despite its location in a sector of space far distant from Earth, has led to it being called the brightest celestial body.
