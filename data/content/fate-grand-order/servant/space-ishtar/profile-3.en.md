### Bond 3

#### Motivation, behavior towards Master

She is intrigued with her Master, who despite being human, is able to form a contract with and skillfully direct Servants.
“What? There’s a role like that in this world? That seems unbelievable and amazing, considering they’re a human!”
Since she believes humans to be weak, she is genuinely impressed by the fact that a human is able to communicate with Servants.
Though she may not show respect to Master, she still considers them to be someone important, and declares with a devilish grin that she will “listen as long as I feel up to it♡”
Because she is a life-form from a different universe, she tries really hard not to get attached to Master more than necessary, but since her emotional shields (read: love flags) are not reinforced, it’s inevitable that she’s going to stray from her convictions at even the slightest prompting.
The normal Ishtar acts friendly, like an older girl next door, but since Space Ishtar acts more distant, the girl next door characteristic is not as pronounced. Instead, she has the air of a standout idol who is rather unobtainable.

#### Independent Action: C

As Space Ishtar was born a goddess, raised by humans, and emerged as a Servant, even if she hasn’t formed a contract with Master, she is able to manifest without consuming magical energy.

#### Core of the Goddess: A++

As she inherited the core of the goddess of ancient harvest and battle, the same basis for various goddesses such as Ashtart and Anat, her ranking is at the high end of the spectrum.
