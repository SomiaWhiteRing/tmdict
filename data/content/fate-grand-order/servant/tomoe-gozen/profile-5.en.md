Shoukannon Bosatsu Mantra.
Anti-personnel Noble Phantasm. Tomoe’s grief at not dying alongside Yoshinaka, combined with her own inner fire and her monstrous oni strength, manifest in the form of a Noble Phantasm.
Shoukannon Bosatsu is the Buddha enshrined at Gichuji Temple, where her beloved Kiso Yoshinaka is entombed. By chanting the mantra, she is able to verify her love for Yoshinaka. She then takes hold of her enemy and hurls them into the air before piercing their body with one of her flaming arrows. This deals damage using magical energy that mimics the sun, representing her feelings towards Yoshinaka.
