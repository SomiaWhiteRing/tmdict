### Clear Main Quest 「Seconda Cantica: Inferno (Ending)」

According to “The Death of Kiso” in volume nine of the “Tale of the Heike,” Kakuichi-bon version, she is described as follows:
“[She] had long black hair and a fair complexion, and her face was very lovely; moreover she was a fearless rider whom neither the fiercest horse nor the roughest ground could dismay and so dexterously did she handle sword and bow that she was a match for a thousand warriors and fit to meet either god or devil.”
A fair-skinned, long haired, and beautiful archer as strong as a thousand warriors…that is indeed Tomoe Gozen.
