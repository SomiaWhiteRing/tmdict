### Bond 2

To crack down on immorality, Raikou became the shadow prefect.
Her slogan is “Unacceptable, unacceptable…unacceptable!”
She’s not the least bit concerned about the outcome of Ishtar’s race. Rather, she’s there exclusively to keep a close eye on any participants likely to let themselves get out of hand using the summer event as an excuse for immoral behavior.

Once she reaches third ascension, she gets so excited she throws off her school uniform…ultimately becoming the most indecent person in the group. She…doesn’t seem to be aware of that. Or…is she…?
