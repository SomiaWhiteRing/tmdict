### Bond 3

#### Madness Enhancement: C

A skill that increases physical abilities at the expense of the user’s sanity. Even as a Lancer, she’s not…entirely sane. Well, at least she’s not nearly as bad as when she’s a Berserker.
It’s really all about her moral sense.
In accordance with her sense of duty and morality, Raikou keeps watch over the sense of decency in all those around her.
Still, she’s not quite aware of her own appearance, so it’s hard to ignore just how much her sanity has decayed…
