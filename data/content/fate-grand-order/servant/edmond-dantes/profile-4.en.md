He is the personification of vengeance itself. He doesn’t belong to any single class, and is summoned as an Extra Class, Avenger. When he materializes as an Avenger, the tales of his lifetime have been elevated to the status of Noble Phantasm and grant him a superhuman physique.
In addition to his physique, he can use magical energy to attack and conceal his own stats and class.

This Noble Phantasm is constantly active. It has an extra effect when his True Name is released, but it is not used in this game.
