### Bond 5

The characteristics of the girl who became a vessel, and the goddess who accepted her light.

She has a kind and tolerant personality. She does not assert herself and is virtuous. She is a talented woman who supports Master from the sidelines.
At least on paper, she sounds like an ideal heroine with high stats, but since she detests anything flashy and chooses safe and steady paths, she’s somewhat of a klutz.

But just because she has a genial personality does not make her timid. She is in fact very strong at her core. No matter how much she is tortured, she is never defeated. In a sense, she is the embodiment of strong will and grit.
Because of that, should she ever become truly angry, she would be absolutely terrifying. Pārvatī NEVER forgets a grudge, and always makes sure matters are settled to her satisfaction.
