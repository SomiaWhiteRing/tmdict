### Bond 5

A Pseudo-Servant who is composed only of the innate goodness of the girl who acts as a vessel.
But no matter how much she is called the light, she isn’t completely devoid of malevolence. Much as it is possible to taint justice, the vessel’s tendency toward being somewhat…yandere… That is, the possibility that she would become dangerous if handled improperly still remains, however faint. 
Having said that, it’s worth noting that she doesn’t just turn evil whenever she gets mad. She does not, after all, simply abandon her sanity when she suffers because of her close connection with the light.

Since Pārvatī possesses the Divinity of a faultless goddess, her withdrawn personality and shyness are gone, and she is very social.
She may get mad or pouty about little things, but whether a misunderstanding or a mix-up, she still reflects on matters logically, and tends to both forgive the person and apologize herself.
