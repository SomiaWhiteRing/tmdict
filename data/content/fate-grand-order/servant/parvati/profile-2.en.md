### Bond 2

In Indian mythology, Pārvatī is the wife of Shiva, the god of creation and destruction.
Pārvatī does not possess any particular domain as a god, and is most commonly treated simply as a goddess wed to Shiva.
However, among Shiva’s wives are those seen as goddesses of war. They are Durga and Kali. Both of them possess different Spirit Origins than Pārvatī, but they are all considered to possess the same goddess core.

She is also able to manifest as a Rider, in which case she would borrow the divine cow Nandi as her mount. As Nandi is primarily responsible for a good harvest, it possesses unusually low attack power compared to typical Divine Beasts.
