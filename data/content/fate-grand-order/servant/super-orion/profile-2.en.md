### Bond 2

Orion, whose name means “to urinate,” was born to the sea god Poseidon and Euryale (not the goddess Euryale). He always bragged that he could take down any beast, but an incident with some ladies caused him to go blind one day. Relying only on the sound of a hammer, he set out to sea and met the goddess of dawn, Eos. With her help, he was able to recover his sight.

It bears mentioning that this was only the beginning of his trouble with goddesses.
