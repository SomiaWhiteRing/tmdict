### Bond 3

In his first battle, he went directly into enemy territory and beheaded twenty-seven enemies. During the Takato-o Castle battle in the Koushu conquest, he killed so many enemies that his victims’ blood soaked his armor bright red, making his allies think he was wounded. He may have boasted exceptional valor, but he was also excessively brutal. Yet at the same time, he was quite skilled―rather he was brilliant―at managing territories. His hobbies included tea ceremonies and reading, revealing a cultured aspect of him. What’s with this guy, seriously?

Apart from the Berserker Class, he also has the capability to be a Lancer or Rider. But no matter what class he gets summoned as, he will somehow always come with Madness Enhancement. His glare, speech, and mannerisms are obviously trouble, and he’s the type who you want to avoid eye contact with, even in public.
