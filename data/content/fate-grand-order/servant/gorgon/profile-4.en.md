### Bond 4

#### Mystic Eyes: A++

She possesses “Cybele,” among the most powerful Mystic Eyes.
However, they are normally sealed.

#### Roar of Fear: A++

A roar that inspires instinctual fear in any living thing that hears it.
Causes fear to all enemies, continuous DEF down, large momentary DEF down, curse, etc.
But it is not used in this game.
