### Clear Main Quest 「Third Knot」

While her very existence is uncertain, like a mirage…or rather, because of that, many legends describe the Queen of Sheba as a great beauty who was able to stand her ground against even the majestic sight of King Solomon.
Yeah…she’s definitely a beauty, but why does it feel like there’s just something…disappointing about her? Well, that’s actually pretty clear. For one thing, she’s entirely focused on building a thriving business. She has no patience for excessive extravagance. Money, treasures, business connections, and get-rich-quick schemes are what excite her the most. Despite all that, it might be wise to keep in mind that her behavior may all be a front, an act by someone who has seen and knows what the future has in store.
