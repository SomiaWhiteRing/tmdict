### Clear Main Quest 「Section 9: “Returning to Tranquil Slumber”」

As Sieg transformed into the evil dragon Fafnir, he carried the Greater Grail to the Reverse Side of the World to prevent the Third Magic from affecting the world. There he waits, hoping that she will come to see him one day.

Sieg as a Servant is more like a terminal rather than an imitation.
Just like Jeanne Alter the Avenger, the day that humanity resumes properly will be the day he disappears, as he will have fulfilled his role.
