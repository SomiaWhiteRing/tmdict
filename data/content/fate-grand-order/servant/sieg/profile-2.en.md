### Bond 2

A Holy Grail War that took place in Romania…
He is one of the homunculi mass-produced for the purpose of supplying magical energy during that Great Holy Grail War. Under ordinary circumstances, he would simply have died and been discarded once his magical energy was drained. But the determination of this homunculus to survive lead him to obtain Siegfried’s power, making him a central figure in the Great Holy Grail War.
