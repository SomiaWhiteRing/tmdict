### Bond 3

#### Independent Action: EX

A subspecies of Servant possession. Other than requiring magical energy whenever he goes into combat, he is no different than any other human being in all aspects. Normally, he would also be of a typical human age, but… 

#### Homunculus: C+

A homunculus manufactured using the Einzbern Family’s methods and technology. This may be a coincidence, but he was born with a personality AND a superior talent for magecraft.

#### Artificial Hero (Fake): B+

A Pseudo-Hero created after inheriting the hero Siegfried’s heart and having electricity from Frankenstein’s Noble Phantasm surge through his body. It may be temporary, but by combining this skill with the Dead-Count Shapeshifter Command Spell, he can become a hero…a Servant.

#### Magecraft: C

Natural talent a homunculus possesses, since they have been manufactured using magical circuits.
He is able to destroy anything, no matter what substance it is made from or how sturdy it may be, by analyzing the target’s components and composing their antithesis to disrupt the overall structure.
However, there is no other use for this skill.

#### Dead-Count Shapeshifter: EX

Dragon Communicating Command Spell.
With his Command Spell, he is able to use Siegfried’s heart, which was implanted into him, as a catalyst to temporarily transform into Siegfried. 
The transformation lasts about three minutes.
