### Bond 3

She’s always in a good mood…or that’s how it seems, though she gets sulky at the drop of a hat. The people around her are sometimes at the mercy of her catlike nature, but she is essentially a party-loving Servant who prioritizes all things fun. Sei was a woman well ahead of her time…a girl who’s slayin’ it and loves anything she finds charming (emotionally triggering).

Her drastic change of appearance does leave open the question of where her distinguished, courtly air as a poet went, but her transformation probably resulted from her strong affinity for modern youth. As biographical information supports that Shounagon was keenly aware of her age during her time in Teishi’s court, her being summoned in the form of a high school girl hardly seems unnatural.

She gets along with Chaldea’s Murasaki Shikibu. (Well, she thinks she does.)
