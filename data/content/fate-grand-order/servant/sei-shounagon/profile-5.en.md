Makura-no-Soushi, Shunshoshou.
A Noble Phantasm that substantiated neither through martial arts nor through the techniques of the Onmyou, but rather through continuous writing. She lets the waves of emotion take her, and the landscape painted within her “Pillow Book” is actualized in a sort of Reality Marble.

To Sei Shounagon, the repainted world becomes a familiar, nostalgic scene which then encroaches into the heart of the target who is incorporated into the bounded field.

Sorrow…nostalgia…poignancy…

The strong emotions that disturb her bubble up from within, allowing her to forget about battle, even if for a second, and the energy and power that possesses her is released, making the intense (and preposterous) attack unavoidable.

As a side note, “Makura-no-Soushi, Shunshoshou” is the annotated edition of “The Pillow Book” written by the poet Kitamura Kigin during the Edo period. That her thoughts have reached across time to strike a chord even with modern audiences is truly a stroke of luck for Sei Shounagon. She uses the “Shunshoshou” as a metaphorical bridge that connects the past to the future, combined with her line of “Dawn is most beautiful in spring…” (shunsho) to beautifully express her sentiments in her Noble Phantasm, ultimately subliming the title “Makura-no-Soushi, Shunshoshou” as her Noble Phantasm’s name.
