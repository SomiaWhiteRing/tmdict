### Bond 2

An author and poet of Japan’s Heian period, she immersed herself in Chinese classics poetry (which were studied exclusively by males at the time). Many tales tell of her arguing down men with her vast knowledge, making her one of the more unconventional female figures of her time. Even in excerpts from “The Diary of Lady Murasaki,” it’s clear that Murasaki Shikibu saw Sei Shounagon as a force to be reckoned with.

She served as a lady-in-waiting to Consort Teishi during the latter half of her twenties. The young Teishi was very affectionate to Shounagon, even though Shounagon was significantly older, and Shounagon reciprocated by loyally serving the beautiful, intelligent consort.

While in court, Shounagon recorded her own observations and musings on court life, and these were later gathered into a collection. This is considered Japan’s first essay anthology, “The Pillow Book.”
