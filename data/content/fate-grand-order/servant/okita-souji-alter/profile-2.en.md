### Bond 2

A different aspect of Okita Souji. This version is a highly specialized Heroic Spirit whose Spirit Origin was altered to exercise her power to act as a deterrent.
As she was designed for a single, temporary manifestation, her Spirit Origin was modified to the point that it became entirely different from the first Okita’s, aside from her essential features. This is also why she has been summoned as an Alter Ego, rather than Okita’s more suitable class of Saber.

She is, in a way, a result of one of the possible lives Okita may have led, since she died so young.
