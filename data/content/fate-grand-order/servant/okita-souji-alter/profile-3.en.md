### Bond 3

#### Independent Action: A

As a Guardian, she is able to act independently. As she manifested in desperate times for the sole purpose of annihilating the target on her own or taking the target out in a suicide attack, this skill was adjusted to be high-ranking.

#### Magic Resistance: B

Unlike the original Okita, this Okita was expected to go up against paranormal beings, and so her Magic Resistance is on par with other Sabers. Oh also, her tendency to be sickly has been cured. Isn’t that unfair? How do we even respond to that…?
