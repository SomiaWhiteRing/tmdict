### Bond 5

Archer Ishtar took off the stem portion of her Boat of Heaven to use it as an arrow. But this time around, she uses the Boat of Heaven’s paddle to change it into a scooter and ride around on it. While it looks like a modern scooter, it performs like the vehicle of a proper goddess. It can fly and it can even warp.
There’s an odd, mysterious creature moving around at Ishtar’s feet, but whatever it is, she’s not telling.

While she considers Master to be a hero of great potential since they saved Uruk, she is also very confused about how such an ordinary-looking person could be a hero. She thinks Master is a very, very strange human.
This time around, Ishtar took Master’s popularity (as a person trusted by the other Servants) into consideration and hired them as a staff member for her Ishtar Cup race…
