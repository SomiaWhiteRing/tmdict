### Clear Main Quest 「Closing Ceremony」

Doesn’t she know when to give up?

The summer festival, Ishtar Cup.
It was actually a grand ritual meant to revive Ishtar’s familiar, the Bull of Heaven, Gugalanna.
She lost Gugalanna the day the Mesopotamian world was struck by a great calamity, and her reputation was horribly tarnished by her mistake. She must have been vigilantly waiting for an opportunity to redeem herself.

And finally, an opportunity presented itself.
Honestly, doesn’t she know when to give up?

Ishtar secretly “borrowed” precious ritual tools from Babylon’s storehouse, and converted them into Holy Grails. With those powers, she set up an overlay of Venus across the land of Connacht and had powerful Heroic Spirits offer their power to the great land (read: race) so that Gugalanna could be created once again. Or at least that was the plan.
That was why the Shrine of Ishtar was converted into a giant magical energy resource integrated circuit. The Ishtar QPS (Quantum Piece System) would suck up magical energy from humans and even from Heroic Spirits and make it all its own…which made it the collection device from hell. The more QP it stored, the more Ishtar’s rank of Divinity would go up. A truly wicked scheme.
