### Bond 4

#### Riding Skill: EX

Ishtar’s ability to ride Maanna, the Boat of Heaven, makes her Riding skill completely different from anything a human might have.
Of course, different doesn’t necessarily mean better… It’s just astonishing in so many ways. Not caring the least bit about traveling through space and time is just Uruk-style driving.

#### Shining Water Robe: A

A skill that changes her great crown into a swimsuit.
The great crown was intended only for Ishtar, but everyone in the party gets one. In exchange, its strength is reduced.

#### Summer Breaker!: A

A goddess who destroys summer (in more ways than one).
A downer version of the skill Goddess Morph.
