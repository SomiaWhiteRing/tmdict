### Bond 2

The eldest of the three Azai sisters, she is Chacha, the one and only.
Her father was Azai Nagamasa, a daimyo in the Oumi Province. Her mother Oichi, was Oda Nobunaga’s younger sister.
Throughout her life, she endured the surrender of three castles, the loss of both her mother and father, and in the end she lost everything.
A woman with a tragic destiny, who later generations branded as an evil, wicked creature who caused the demise of Toyotomi.
“…Ch-Chacha never did that!”
