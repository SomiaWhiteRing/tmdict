A Single Shot at the Celestial Scorpion.
A manifestation of the story of Chiron as Sagittarius poised to attack the scorpion in the heavens. This Noble Phantasm, the ultimate shot for which all bowmen eternally strive, can pierce even a star. This shot can be used the moment its True Name is revealed, and it is no mere arrow, but a shooting star that streaks across the sky.
Even Achilles, known to be a fast runner, could not evade this Noble Phantasm.
The sole drawback is that it can be used only once each night. However, if it’s used correctly at the right time, it is certain to hit its mark.
