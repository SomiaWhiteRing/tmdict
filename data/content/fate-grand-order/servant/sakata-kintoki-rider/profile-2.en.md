Yoroshiku, Golden Dash.
Transforms Golden Bear into its Ultra-Accelerating Assault Form and rams into the enemy.
Golden Bear’s tires also transform into the drums of the Thunder God; with each spin it increases its damage potential.
He is summoned with emphasis on his trait as the son of a thunder god, but at the same time, his trait as the son of a man-eating mountain witch is also amplified. As a result, he could be more dangerous than his Berserker self. Or maybe he’s just enjoying riding his monster bike.
