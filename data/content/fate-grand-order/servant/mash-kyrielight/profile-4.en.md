### Clear Singularity 5 Main Quest 「Feet on the Ground, Eyes on the Stars」

#### Succeed Phantasm: ?

A special skill usable by Demi-Servants.
The user can succeed one skill from the possessed Heroic Spirit, and then make it into the user’s own skill.
In the case of Mash, the skill is “Magical Defense.”
Similar with “Mana Burst”, the user transforms magical energy into defensive ability.
If it’s a Heroic Spirit with tremendous amount of magical energy, it’s possible to create a wall protecting an entire nation.
