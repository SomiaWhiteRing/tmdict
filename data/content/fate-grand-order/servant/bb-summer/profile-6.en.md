### Bond 5

BB fused herself with two divinities. The second of these was a being not of this Earth, but an entity from the depths of space, and one that should not normally exist in this universe at all. It could only be described as an evil god, a malevolent creature that seduces, torments, and destroys thinking things.

Using this evil god’s power, BB trapped the Hawaiian Islands in a cage of time. By creating an endless time loop of vacation during which she hosted a festival, she hoped to save Master from the terrors awaiting in their future.

There’s really no point debating the truth of her actions or motivations, or how the event ended for that matter. It comes down to this: BB will always be BB. The end.

But did she really synchronize with the evil god? Maybe BB just thought she did…like a placebo.
