### Bond 3

The girl’s motives for assassinating Jean-Paul Marat are complex. But if it had to be described in a single phrase, it would be “to save a hundred thousand lives.”
In her eyes, Marat was someone who agitated the citizens and continued to cause bloodshed in the name of revolution and was the very cause of the nightmarish upheaval in France.

Normally, this reckless plan would never have worked. But with a bit of luck on her side and no small amount of contempt, she managed the assassination.

Later, investigators would attempt to determine whether or not she had anyone else working with her in the assassination plot. While there were those she deceived to obtain referrals, it was concluded that Charlotte Corday did indeed work alone.

She was ultimately executed by guillotine, and the executioner was none other than Charles-Henri Sanson. Sanson spent two hours with Corday, accompanying her from her cell to the execution site and later praised her in his memoir, saying she was valiant until the end, showing neither fear nor anger.
