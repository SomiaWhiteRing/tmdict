### Bond 5

#### Gift of the Stars: B

A skill earned by playing the role of Santa Claus.
She gives presents to warm others’ hearts.
While she wants to give out presents and make others happy, she is not so great at understanding what people want, and has an especially modest personality. As such, her sill rank is lower than Santa Alter (Altria)’s. Also the skill’s name changed slightly for some reason.

#### Rainbow Candy: B

The star on top of the Christmas tree is called the Star of Bethlehem, and it is said to represent the birth of the Savior.
Being struck by Altera’s (candy) cane is said to confer great blessings.

#### Crest of the Shiny Star: EX

This skill became what it was by combining the distinctive designs on Altera’s body with the concept of Christmas.
With the powerful blessing it grants, Altera awakens her latent powers engraved within her Spirit Origin to activate her Santa Altera form, but only for three minutes!
A last resort super power-up that lasts only three turns.

#### Natural Body: -

When she became the Heroic Spirit of Christmas, the concept of winter was added to her Spirit Origin, and so she is no longer able to adjust her body temperature. As such, this skill unfortunately no longer works.
