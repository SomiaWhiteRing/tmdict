### Bond 4

#### Magic Resistance: C

In consequence of being so much gentler, she is unable to counter claims of people who say that they received the wrong present. This somehow also makes her Magic Resistance weaker than when she is a Saber.

#### Riding Skill: EX

When she was chosen to be the Heroic Spirit of Christmas, Altera’s powerful sense of duty flared to life. This both radically strengthened and altered her Riding Skill. Specifically, she became a sheepmaster.
The sight of her riding her famed horse…uh, that is, her famed sheep evokes images of the great and powerful king of the Huns who swept across the West… Err…well…sort of?

#### Civilization Encroachment: EX

A skill Altera triggers unconsciously. It makes whatever she has into the best thing for her in a given moment. “The best” in this case doesn’t really mean “superior” though. It’s really more about what Altera is into at the moment. And what she’s into right now is…pretty clear.
The horses that should have been with her as her subordinates are sheep (well, sort of), and her Sword of the War God is now a (candy) Cane of the War God.
