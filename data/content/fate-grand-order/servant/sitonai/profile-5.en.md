Howl My Friend, My Power.
The hunting dog who served as companion to Sitonai, the girl hero of Ainu, became a kind of familiar. Louhi and Freyja’s magecraft from the Age of Gods strengthened it, and now it appears more like a large bear instead of a hound, making it closer to a spirit.

“A familiar for a goddess should be massive, and it wouldn’t be fitting if it was some Demonic Beast or Phantasmal.”

…That’s what Louhi said anyway, and Freyja agreed. So with two out of three votes, the familiar became a bear.

This Noble Phantasm is continuously active. When its True Name is revealed, the familiar releases a series of vicious attacks before Sitonai fires an arrow imbued with icy magical energy at the target. Sitonai’s characteristics triggers a special effect against dragons.
