#### Kamuy Yukar: A

An epic song in which the performer plays the part of the Kamuy. As an Alter Ego, performing Kamuy Yukar enables her to borrow many of the Kamuyâ€™s powers described in Ainu myth. Even the powers related to the higher-ranked Kamuy, Pase Kamuy of the mountains, village, and open sea, can be used.

#### Red Gold: B++

Even though Freyja enthralled various deities and even enemy giants, she loved only one person. When her loved one left on a journey, Freyja was said to have wept tears of red gold out of concern for his welfare.
