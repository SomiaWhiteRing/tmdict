### Bond 3

A knight in shining armor. A perfect gentleman with a perfect smile.
Despite his serious character, he has no gloomy aspects and treats everyone with honesty and sincerity.
He gets enraged from time to time but since he never holds any negative emotion such as hatred or jealousy, his attitude is refreshing no matter which battlefield he is on.
According to other knights of the Round Table, “it’s almost a talent to be as likeable as him.”
