### Bond 4

Because of his good heart and natural airheadedness, people could never bring themselves to envy him despite his being blessed with both unparalleled talents and a good family.
Heâ€™s a loyal knight, and his loyalty to the king is strong as iron.
To Gawain, his only wish is to become a sword for the king, to serve for the king.
For those who does not know his true nature, they might mistaken his loyalty as blind faith.
