### Bond 2

Nitocris was embarrassed with herself.
She was deeply ashamed for showing disrespect to Pharaoh Ozymandias, so she tugged a large sheet over her head to make herself look like a Medjed, saying “I have no right to show my face!” 
(First Ascension)

However, she still possesses some small sense of pride as a pharaoh within her.
She merely feels embarrassed towards the other pharaohs.

She only changed her clothes, and yet her Spirit Origin also changed.
She’s become an Assassin, and has a different Noble Phantasm to boot…but it’s still the same old Nitocris.
She’s still the same careless, short-tempered pharaoh who’s constantly jumping to conclusions.
Consistency is nice.
