### Bond 3

#### White Imperial Garments: A

A white robe that Nitocris is wearing.
This sacred robe is apparently proof of favor and protection from the god Medjed. Of course, this is just what Nitocris claims, so there’s really no way of knowing the truth of the matter.

#### Beach Panic: EX

What’s that…?
What…?
Whether she actually has the sacred guardianship of the god Medjed or not is unclear, but Nitocris seems to be drawing the attention of everyone just by standing there in her robe.
