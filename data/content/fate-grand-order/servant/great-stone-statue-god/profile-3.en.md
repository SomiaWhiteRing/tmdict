### Bond 3

Occasionally, anyone who has had some sort of connection with the vessel girl may blurt her name out, but that only happens subconsciously, and no one nearby will hear the name as anything meaningful.

Given that she’s manifested as an Extra Class, there is some belief that a super AI was involved in forming this Servant, but the truth is still lost to the aether…or one might also say that it’s in another world, on the far side of the moon…
