### Bond 2

A Divine Spirit that housed itself in a human vessel to become a Pseudo-Servant… That’s the theory, anyway, but there are more than a few mysteries remaining about their background. Honestly, all the details are patchy and a little…buggy.

For some reason the name of the human mage who is thought to be the vessel is listed as the Saint Graph’s name, and for some reason it’s conceptually illegible. This is why Chaldea’s staff, including Master, call her by the name she prefers, which is “Ms. Ganesha.”

Whether or not the Indian Divine Spirit Ganesha is really inside is honestly…not entirely clear.
