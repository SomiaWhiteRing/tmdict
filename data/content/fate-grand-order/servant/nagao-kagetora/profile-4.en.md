### Bond 4

#### Fate Decreed by Heavens: A

As Kenshin believed in the protection of Bishamonten, she is able to receive a number of advantages on the battlefield.

#### Armor Strengthened by Heart: A

A skill for defense against projectile weapons. This skill originates in one of the many stories about Kagetora, in which it was said that she casually sipped wine in front of her enemies while bullets were exchanged, and every shot missed. Her extreme sense of pride triggers a phenomenon not unlike warping reality. As long as she thinks she will never be hit, the bullets themselves will curve to avoid her. However, if a shot is imbued with sufficient determination to make her think it might hit her, it may break through this protection.

#### Glory Gained on Foot: A

Kagetora’s battle instincts that earned her praise as a peerless warrior in Japan. She engaged in seventy-plus battles and won a majority of them. She’s not quite as good when it comes to besieging castles, though.

“Argh! Come on out and fight!”
