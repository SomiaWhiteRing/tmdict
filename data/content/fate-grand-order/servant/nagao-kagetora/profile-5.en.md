Biten Hassou Kurumagakari no Jin.
This Noble Phantasm is derived from Nagao Kagetora’s signature tactic called the “kuruma gakari” formation. This formation typically is composed of multiple units, and the units continually reinforce each other to keep up their attack on the enemy.

At the revelation of its True Name, a fully armed and mounted Kagetora splits into eight and attacks the enemy successively…a solo kuruma gakari formation attack.

“Gallop, Houshou Tsukige! Bishamonten’s protection is with us!”

Typically her favorite horse, Houshou Tsukige, would only be summoned if she were a Rider Class. But we see yet another outrageous rule breaking attempt using the name of Bishamonten with this forceful summoning.
