### Bond 3

Daughter of the Dragon:
Perhaps the presence of a dragon in the Báthory family emblem is the reason that Elisabeth has dragon genes in her, and that those genes manifested when she was summoned as a Servant.
She might look like a common demon with her wings and tail, but those are dragon appendages, okay? And those fangs? A dragon’s, of course. Not a vampire’s.
