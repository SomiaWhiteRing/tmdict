Demon King of the Sixth Heaven’s Demon -Natsumori-.
The Demon King Nobunaga’s true Noble Phantasm that destroys all deities… Well, a slight variation. 
It is a Reality Marble in a limited-release state that transforms her into a great and powerful being when fighting divine enemies. Upon release, a mysterious giant skeleton (Temp) will manifest itself behind Nobbu’s back to wield the power of the Demon King.
