### Bond 3

#### Hyde

A man without morals or mercy who kills for fun - the “evil” personality.
An Anti-Hero who intuitively tries to hurt everything he sees.
It’s unknown whether the evil lurked within Jekyll’s heart, or the lack of evil within him stopped the creation of something far more sinister.
