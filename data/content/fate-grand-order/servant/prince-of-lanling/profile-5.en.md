The Heroic Masked One, Prince of Ling with the Beautiful Face and Voice.
A song said to have been created by the soldiers who praised the gallant battles fought by the masked Prince of Lan Ling.
The music piece traveled to Japan as imperial court music during the Tang dynasty. It is performed even to this day.
This composition, praising his bravery and beauty, rouses the morale of allies while causing enemies to shrink away.
Additionally, Prince of Lan Ling was lauded to have both a beautiful voice and face, so he himself inflicts immense pressure and a kind of beautiful terror that the enemy cannot take their eyes from.
