### Clear Interlude 「King of Kings」

Dealing with Mordred is easy.
Don’t insult King Arthur.
Don’t praise King Arthur.
Don’t treat Mordred as a woman.
Don’t be too obvious about treating Mordred as a man.
Don’t be too formal.
Don’t be infatuated with other Servants.
Listen to what Mordred says.
See?
Simple, right?
