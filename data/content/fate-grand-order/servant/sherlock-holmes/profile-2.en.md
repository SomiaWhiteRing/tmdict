### Bond 2

A man who is thoughtful yet decisive, daring yet grandiose, and always calm and collected. No mystery, crime, or intrigue can confound Holmes. Whether it be a terrifying murderer, an ancient curse, a monster in the dark of night, or an international secret societyâ€¦he will always uncover its secrets, and if necessary vanquish it, for no blade is keener than the truth.

His existence is beyond mere humanity, and he can even be considered to be a manifestation of a wise man and a truth-seeker.
