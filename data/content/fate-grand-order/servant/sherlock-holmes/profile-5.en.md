### Bond 5

Normally, this Noble Phantasm is of a type that is always active, but in FGO, the True Name must be revealed.
The moment the True Name is revealed, a mysterious sphere appears, emitting a blinding light that illuminates its surroundings. Enemies are weakened, while allies are strengthened. Even if there is an enemy that normally is impossible to defeat, Holmes will discover some means to do so.

As a side note, while this NP’s True Name is one of Holmes’s best-known phrases, it first appeared not in Doyle’s work, but in the stage play written by, directed by, and starring William Gillette. Doyle praised Gillette’s Holmes as remarkable, better even than his own stories.
By the way, Holmes actually does use the word “elementary” in Doyle’s short story “The Adventure of the Crooked Man.” It’s said that is where Gillette derived his inspiration.
