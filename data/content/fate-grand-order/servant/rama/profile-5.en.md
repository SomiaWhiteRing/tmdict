The Rakshasa-Piercing Immortal.
An indestructible blade that he’s carried since birth in order to defeat the rakshasa Ravana.
It is incredibly powerful against demonic enemies.
Originally an arrow, it was intended to be fired from a bow, but Rama wanted to be a Saber so he turned it into a sword.
However, it maintains its capabilities as a throwing weapon, and this sword can be thrown at his foes.
It’s not a good idea to point out this discrepancy.
