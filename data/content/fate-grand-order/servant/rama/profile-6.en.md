### Clear Interlude 「Vishnu’s Test」

His wish for the Grail is to be reunited with Sita.
Even in death, even as a Heroic Spirit, the curse that binds him has not faded.
The curse will last as long as they both love each other, and in a way, is a sign of their love for one another.
He is summoned as his younger self, because that’s his peak condition when he was fighting to get Sita back.
