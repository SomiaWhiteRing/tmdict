### Bond 5

Okada Izoâ€¦a man who had an exceptional gift with the blade, being able to mimic any skill or style simply by watching it. With this terrifying talent, Izo was thrust into the Bakumatsu period, becoming an extraordinary killer.

Touted as the master of divine punishment, Izo was one of the prominent man-slayers in Japanese history, having undertaken many assassinations. He was, however, never successful as a true swordsman.

Whether it was because of the change in times or some twist of fate, this genius of the sword was sadly never able to hone his talent nor develop his skill.
