### Clear Singularity 7 Main Quest 「Star of the Beginning, We Look Up at the Sky」

Tiamat returned to the world after the collapse of the Foundation of Humanity, and with the power of the Grail. However, she was in a deep sleep.
This was due to Merlin’s spell, but even so, Chaldea’s attack awakened her and caused her to instinctively attempt to wipe out humanity.

Part of this was due to her rage, hatred, and sorrow at being abandoned once she was no longer useful. But it was also an attempt to feel the joy that would come if she were to recreate Earth’s ecosystems and once again become the mother of all things.

This nature was what decided her Class.
Her True Name is not “The Goddess of Creation.”
She is a great disaster, the most rejected being in all of human history, and something that humanity long ago left behind.

Her name is Beast II.
One of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and a beast which possesses the law of Recurrence.
