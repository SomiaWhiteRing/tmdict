### Bond 5

Altria never took the path of evil in her life. But she did have doubts, worries, anger at herself, and sorrow for those around her.
This form is where the curse made those thoughts surface, and completely reversed her “principles.”
Her objective and her ideals have not changed.
Normally Altria is kind and just, but this Altria feels that oppression is also a path to obtain her ideals.
