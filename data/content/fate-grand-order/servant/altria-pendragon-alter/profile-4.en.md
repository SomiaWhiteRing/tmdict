Sword of Promised Victory.
The sword shines with dark aura. Because she wields the sacred sword as she sees fit without controlling her power, the magical energy particles do not emit light, but darkness.
It is similar to the breath of the dragon Vortigern, which once revealed itself to protect the island of Britain.
