### Clear Interlude 「Treasure Island」

A hedonist who prefers momentary pleasure, and at the end, her last moment was dazzling.
This Heroic Spirit was not obsessed with life (One’s own life, the meaning and pride as a human,) and rather accepted the idea of death (the eventual end that awaits all humanity.)
At the age of 53, she fell victim to illness.
It’s said that just before her death, she strangely tried to wear her armor in bed.
