### Bond 2

During his lifetime, he was one who fought for the hopes and dreams of all around him. He rose to power as emperor with a great deal of support from the people. Even after he was exiled to the island of Elba, he returned when the people cried out for an emperor, and then when the people rejected the emperor, he once more fell to ruin.

Napoleon the Heroic Spirit answers pleas, responds to desires, and does what is expected of him to accomplish whatever he takes on. Through the acknowledgement of various Napoleonic legends and becoming an embodiment of possibilities for humanity (apex primates), the man manifests into this world as a Servant.
