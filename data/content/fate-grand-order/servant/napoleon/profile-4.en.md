### Bond 4

#### Light of Possibility: B

A skill quite similar to Pioneer of the Stars and, to a certain degree, Innocent Monster.
All the legends pertaining to him, whether they be true or not, are all accepted to create an idealized version of the Heroic Spirit Napoleon. Upon his manifestation, he acts as, and ultimately becomes, the embodiment of expectation and possibility for all.
“Yeah, I guess I did that too.”
The light of possibility…like a rainbow.
Any enemy who encounters him is sure to see a rainbow streak across the sky.

#### Imperial Privilege: B

As he became the first French emperor, he possesses Imperial Privilege. However, in this game, this skill is typically not used.
