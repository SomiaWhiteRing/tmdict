### Bond 2

Paris was born the son of King Priam, but a prophecy declaring that the newly born child would cause Troy’s destruction led to him being abandoned at Mt. Ida.
But when Agelaus, the very man who was ordered by the king to abandon Paris, witnessed the baby suckling on the milk of a she-bear to survive, he decided to take the child in and raise it as his own.
As a side note, the name Paris means “sack,” which was given to him after he was carried home in a bag.
