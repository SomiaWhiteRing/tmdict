### Clear Interlude 「Drunkenness, Madness, and Rage」

Shuten doesn’t talk about her wish for the Holy Grail.
Both past and present, all she ever wanted was to live her own life, in her own way.
Also, she’s an avid collector of rare antiques, with a keen interest in the dragon’s bone within Kintoki’s arm.
She only cares for the rarest and most elegant items, unlike the King of Heroes who values ability and history.
