### Bond 3

Originally, this sacred spear is the “Pillar of Light” that sews together the two sides of the world.
It is said that if this was ever undone, the current world composed by the laws of physics would collapse, and many phantasmal laws that became things of the past would reappear.
Due to her status as the final king who stood in the Age of Gods and fantasy, she possesses this sacred spear that conceals such immense power.
