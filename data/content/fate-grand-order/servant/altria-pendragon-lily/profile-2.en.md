### Bond 2

A romantic knight who betters herself daily to become the ideal king.
She is still half-boiled so she still acts like a girl, and her heart is filled with dreams and hope.
When she vacations in different countries, she spends her time with her brother-in-law Sir Kay, and their accompanying mage Merlin.
Things usually start with Altria making a fuss, then frustrating Merlin, and Kay picking up the pieces.
