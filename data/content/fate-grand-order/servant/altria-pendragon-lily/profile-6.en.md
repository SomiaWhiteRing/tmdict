### Clear Interlude 「Sword of a Young Flower」

Caliburn and Excalibur are different sacred swords.
Caliburn nurtures royalty, and raises Arthur into a king.
Originally, Caliburn was used for ceremonies.
Using this as a weapon by releasing its True Name can exert the same firepower as Excalibur, but the sword will not be able to withstand Altria’s magical energy and will likely disintegrate.
