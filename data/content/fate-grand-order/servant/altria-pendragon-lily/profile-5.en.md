### Bond 5

The destined child born to save Britain from its destruction and path to ruin. A “reincarnation of a dragon” created by the previous king Uther and the mage Merlin. This is why she is referred to as the Red Dragon that protects Britain.
Has the heart of a dragon, the highest rank of phantasmals, and the amount of magical energy that can be created within her body overwhelms all other Heroic Spirits.
