### Bond 4

#### 『Caliburn』

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B (Conditionally A+)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>NP Type</td><td>Anti-Personnel</td></tr>

Golden Sword of Assured Victory.
Originally a sword used to select a king, the “Anti-Personnel” is not against an enemy, but to one who will wield the sword in the future. If the wielder stays just as a king, and is finally deemed worthy, its strength will be appropriate for a sacred sword.
