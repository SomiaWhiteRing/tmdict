### Bond 3

#### Imperial Privilege: EX

Skills she normally wouldn’t have can be gained momentarily because she declared it.
This is the perfect skill for Nero who is the manifestation of passion.
She gains skills such as Riding, Swordsmanship, Arts, Charisma, Tactics…etc.
If the skill is above Rank A, the physical burden (such as Divinity) is gained as well.
