### Bond 3

This version of her is a Heroic Spirit of Heaven that has personally returned the sacred lance at Camlann Hill, and after that returned to Earth.
However, the “Lion King” who shared the same appearance as her did not die when it was her time. At the end, she became a wondering soul trapped on earth, forever wielding the lance.
The “Lion King” who kept possessing the sacred lance has completely turned into a Divine Spirit, and is thus a whole different existence from this version of her.
