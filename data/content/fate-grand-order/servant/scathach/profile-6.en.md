### Clear Interlude 「Kill Me If You Can」

After so long, Scáthach has finally ascended to the level of half a Divine Spirit.
She cannot die a beautiful death, nor can she die an ugly one.
All she can do is continue to exist until the world, both inside and out, disappears.
If the Grail is truly almighty, send someone who can actually kill me.
Also, if possible, let that someone be the possessor of the spear I once bestowed with my own hands…
