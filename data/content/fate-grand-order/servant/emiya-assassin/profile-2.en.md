### Bond 2

Originally he was not a Heroic Spirit.
He killed many people as an assassin,
but his existence did not ascend to the Throne of Heroes.
He is a “pseudo-Heroic Spirit,” also known as a Guardian, and in the proper course of human history does not exist.
Only when a threat attempts to destroy human history itself from its very foundation… Only in a Grand Order does this “possibility” exist.
