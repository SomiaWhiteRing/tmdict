### Bond 2

In this manifestation, she has no interest in serving as a mentor to heroes. She also has no mastery of any martial arts. Unlike Lancer Scáthach, who was proud yet friendly, Scáthach-Skadi is prone to more callous statements, like: “Did I step on something?”, “Ah, a tiny thing (humans),” and “Shall I love it? Or shall I kill it?”. These serve to characterize her divine nature.

A mere sigh can create a blizzard. Living things seldom survive.

A smile can bring about eternal spring. Living things thrive and exult.

She sees little difference in either outcome.
