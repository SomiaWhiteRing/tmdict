### Bond 3

The name Skadi means “one who harms” in Old Norse. According to the Poetic Edda’s Grímnismál, she is the daughter of the abominable giant, Þjazi, and lived in the ancient mansion Þrymheimr with her father.
She is later married to Norse gods, so she is also called “the shining bride of the gods.”

Skadi also goes by the name of Öndurguð (ski god) or Öndurdís (ski goddess). She was considered a master huntress of the mountains and an expert skiier.
