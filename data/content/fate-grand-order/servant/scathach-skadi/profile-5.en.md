The Gate Leading to Dún Scáith, Brimming with Death.
The giant gate that leads to the Land of Shadows, a land cut off from the world, is briefly summoned. The shadow castle that sits in the Land of Shadows, typically a land ruled by Scáthach of the Celts rather than Skadi, reveals itself.

Of those in range of the Noble Phantasm’s effects, any deemed worthy will be granted divine blessings and great fortune by the shadow castle’s presence. Anyone beloved by the castle’s queen, even the most feeble, will find themselves empowered to defeat terrible enemies.

This Noble Phantasm may produce a remarkable turnaround if used in a Holy Grail War.

Scáthach-Skadi does not fully understand why she uses this Noble Phantasm. The only thing she is aware of is that the blessings of the Nordic gods likely allowed her to wield the power of the Land of Shadows that originates from her other self (the Celtic Scáthach). That’s about it.
