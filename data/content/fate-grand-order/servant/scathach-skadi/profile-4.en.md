### Bond 4

In FGO, Scáthach and Skadi are not completely the same. Rather, they influence each other, and are in many senses intertwined. The fact that Lancer Scáthach has inherited Odin’s Primordial Rune is likely a consequence of this mix (syncretism).

According to the Heimskringla, the Old Norse kings’ saga, Skadi divorced her first husband Njörðr, the sea god, and married Odin.
This version of Skadi, though, is unmarried. However, she must still be similar enough to the figure of legend to draw so much attention and be remembered by future generations. Probably…

The Scáthach-Skadi in the Lostbelt is much more Skadi than she is Scáthach, and that is why she embodies more of the aspects of the bride of the gods.
