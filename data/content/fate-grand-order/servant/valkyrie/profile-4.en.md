### Bond 4

Thrúd
Hildr
Ortlinde

These three sisters have been verified and found to rotate, based on Chaldea’s summoning and Ascension system. They are likely individuals that have bonded with a Master or will bond with one in the future.
While there may only be minute differences in how much magical energy each possesses, they are essentially the same in nature and they all manifest under the same True Name of Valkyrie. Although they actually have their own individual names of Thrúd, Hildr, and Ortlinde, the girls reject the idea of being treated as separate entities.

“There is no innate difference between the Valkyries.”
“That’s right. We are all connected, sharing the same roots.”
“Yes. Sister Brynhild is the strange one…”
So she…they…say.
