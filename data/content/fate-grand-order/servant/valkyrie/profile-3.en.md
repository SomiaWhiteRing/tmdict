### Bond 3

This Servant Valkyrie has manifested under special circumstances. Namely, she possesses an atypical Spirit Origin.

While her magical energy may increase as her chemistry with her Master improves, unlike other Servants, her Spirit Origin does not transform into a more powerful state, since each Valkyrie has a limit to her power.

For Chaldeaâ€™s summoning system, whenever a Valkyrie undergoes Ascension, there is a high probability that the current individual Valkyrie will disappear and a different Valkyrie who is better able to withstand the redefined magical energy capacity is summoned to replace the former.
