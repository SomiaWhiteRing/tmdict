### Bond 2

Daughters of the Allfather Odin, they are at once individuals and a singular collective that makes up the entity called Valkyrie. A being very close to a Divine Spirit demigod, which enables them to possess high ranked Divinity.

Valkyrie is made up of multiple beings created en masse by Odin the Allfather in preparation for the Twilight of the Gods, or Ragnarök, and they operate and function almost like an automated machine.

They mounted celestial horses and flew through the skies over battlefields, selecting fallen souls to take to Valhalla. However, when the eldest daughter, Brynhild, met the hero Sigurd and gained intense emotion and individuality, this became the turning point that led to the fall in their numbers.

Around the mid-1980s, a report was turned in to the Lord of the Curses Department at the Clock Tower which hypothesized that the number of Valkyrie had dwindled down by half by the time the final war between gods and giants, Ragnarök, began. The claim was temporarily a hot topic within the magecraft world.
