### Bond 5

Last time, Nero fumed at not being invited to the festival in the southern isles.
This time around, she prepared herself by getting a swimsuit to be certain she would be ready to join the festivities. That’s about when the Ishtar Cup began, so she signed up enthusiastically.
However, she discovers that she needs a teammate, so she pulls Altria Alter aside, who was just passing by, and a miraculous team was formed.

Her favorite car is the Red Venus.
For any of you wondering why the name Venus was used, go check out “Fate/EXTELLA.”
