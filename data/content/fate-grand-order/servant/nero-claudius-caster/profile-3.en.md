Glorious Song, Golden Theater.
Just when you think that the wind pipe instruments were added to the golden theater, you realize they are actually cannons.
It’s unclear whether this was someone’s wild idea, or if the architect was of sound mind. But…pipe organs really do look like artillery. Such is the complex history of how this musical theater fortress was born.

As Nero acquired her Spirit Origin as a singer, she is demonstrating that talent to its fullest extent.
The golden theater is not limited within the theater walls, and her singing voice can be heard outside by simply pointing past its walls…instantly making it an outdoor concert stage.
