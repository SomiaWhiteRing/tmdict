### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

Chaldea’s first successfully summoned Heroic Spirit.

The Grand Caster secretly summoned by Marisbury Animusphere that participated and achieved victory in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.

His wish on the Holy Grail was to become human.
He did not use the power of the Grail to incarnate as a Heroic Spirit, but instead, abandoned all his powers as a Heroic Spirit to be reborn as a new human that had nothing to do with King Solomon.

His new name was Romani Archaman.
A normal young man who wanted only to live a normal life as an individual.

…But even in his second life, he was never to know the happiness and fulfillment that came with being human.
The vision of humanity’s destined end, which he glimpsed right before becoming human, stole away all of his freedom.
