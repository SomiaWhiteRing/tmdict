The Time of Parting Hath Come, I Am He Who Surrenders the World.
The first Noble Phantasm of King Solomon.
A Noble Phantasm possessed by the true King Solomon, not Goetia.
An aria that relinquishes all his great deeds, miracles, and magecraft that he achieved in his life.

By activating this Noble Phantasm, Solomon returns the blessings that God bestowed on him back to Heaven, and loses the eyes that watch over the world.
The result is the death of King Solomon.
And in turn, the self-destruction of the 72 Demon Gods.
It can be described as a “safety device” put in place by King Solomon in case such a time comes when magecraft becomes a threat to humanity in the distant future, allowing him to destroy it.
When this is used as a Noble Phantasm, all traces of King Solomon disappear from this world.
…even from the Throne of Heroes.
