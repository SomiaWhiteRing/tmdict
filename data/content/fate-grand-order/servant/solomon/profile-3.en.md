### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

“Class Skills”

#### Territory Creation: A

The ability for a mage to create a territory that benefits them.
The techniques he developed while building the Temple of Israel granted him the highest level of power in this skill.

#### Rapid Casting: C

The ability to speed up magecraft casting. He is fast, but he stresses over things and the pressure causes him to make mistakes.

#### Item Construction: C

The ability to create magically enhanced tools. Perhaps due to his specialized contract, his tool creation ability remained at an average level.
