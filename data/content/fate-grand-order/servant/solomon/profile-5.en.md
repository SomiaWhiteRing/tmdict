### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

Only after becoming a human named Roman did Solomon gain human nature. 
He is, at his core, more of a realist and pessimist.
He will say optimistic things to try and keep others’ spirits up, but since he does not really mean it, he comes off as insincere.
He likes humans, but since he is a coward who does not want to experience sadness, he keeps all his relationships at a superficial level.
At the same time, this gives him the ability to get along with anyone.
When things get bad, he has a bad habit of observing without making decisions or simply ignoring things in order to maintain the status quo. 
Since Roman himself realizes that this is a weakness of his, a single encouraging word from someone around him can cause him to regain control and make decisive choices worthy of the King of Mages.

By the way, every Servant’s first impression of him is along the lines of, “I don’t know why, but this is his fault,” and they would subconsciously find things to complain about.
The only ones who did not complain were non-Servants, contrarians, and Berserkers who do not recognize evil as evil.
