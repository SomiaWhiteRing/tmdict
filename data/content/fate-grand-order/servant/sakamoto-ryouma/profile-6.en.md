### Bond 5

He never wanted to shoot anyone. He never wanted to kill anyone.

At first, he did it for the neighborhood kids. Then for his friends back in his hometown. Then his comrades. Finally, for Japan.

His innate softheartedness compelled him to devote himself to others as he raced through his life and era. Everyone loved him. Everyone hated him. Ultimately, he was killed without mercy. But he did not resent his death, nor regret his life. From the very beginning until the end, he dreamt of a world where everyone could live happily. That was all he wanted.
