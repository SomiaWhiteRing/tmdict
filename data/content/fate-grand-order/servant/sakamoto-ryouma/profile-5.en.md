### Bond 5

The black-haired woman by Ryouma’s side is named Oryou. After Ryouma rescued her from her imprisonment on a certain mountain, she fell in love. Using repaying his kindness as an excuse, she tags along with him, becoming something of a pushy wife figure.
She is not a dragon. Rather, to be specific, she is more of a mizuchi or an orochi…a being that’s not quite a dragon. Some might say that Ryouma’s great accomplishments during the Bakumatsu period depended upon her help from the shadows…but maybe not.
As a side note, she was unfortunately away from Ryouma during his final moments, and was unable to help him. Heartbroken and in mourning, she disappeared into the bottom of the ocean, never ascending to the heavens as a dragon.
