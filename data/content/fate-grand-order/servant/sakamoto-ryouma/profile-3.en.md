#### Hero of Reform: A

A special skill that was awarded to Ryouma, who rode through the turbulent times of the Bakumatsu and contributed tremendously to the extraordinary historical reformation known as the Meiji Restoration.

#### Charisma: C+

#### Divinity: B-

Her skin is so tough, no blades can pierce it. Her long hair that reaches the ground is so hard, it actually digs into the ground when it’s dragged.

#### Rampage: B
