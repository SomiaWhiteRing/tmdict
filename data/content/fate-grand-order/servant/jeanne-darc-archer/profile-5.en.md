O Fruitful Ocean, with Great Happiness.
A summoning of phantasmals by offering a prayer to the ocean. Because she has some sort of connection with phantasmals, she’s able to call forth pretty much anything from the sea and use their powers. The highlight of this Noble Phantasm is the blue whale. It squishes things to death. Maybe someday she’ll even be able to summon a megalodon.
