### Bond 4

#### Enjoying Endless Summer!: A

EES for short.
The determination to enjoy summer to the fullest!

#### Saint of the Shore (Dolphin): A+

For some reason, dolphins really like her now that she’s an Archer. They will attack any of Jeanne’s enemies.

#### Servant Cheer!: B

Though she is no longer a Ruler, she still does her best to cheer everyone else on. She loves to encourage people to do their best while squeezing their hand, which will inevitably give them the wrong idea. She just thinks it’s a way to be supportive.
