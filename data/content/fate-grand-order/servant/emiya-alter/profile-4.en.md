“Unlimited Lost Works” is one of the ends arrived at by a mage who devoted his life to forging swords.
This Reality Marble contains every weapon that embodies the concept of “a sword” that he has seen.
However, “Unlimited Lost Works” actually materializes its weapons inside an opponent’s body, rupturing them from the inside with tremendous force.
