### Bond 4

Anne Bonny and Mary Read want someone they can depend on more than anyone else, someone that they can fight alongside with. They seem to have gotten that with their Master at Chaldea, and are quite attached to him… But a certain anonymous princess keeps on complaining that it’s against the rules to sneak into Master’s My Room.
