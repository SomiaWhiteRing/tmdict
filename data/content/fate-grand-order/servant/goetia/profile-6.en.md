### Clear Main Quest 「Return」

And thus began Goetia’s plot, the thing which called itself Solomon, the King of Mages. He created the Holy Grails as Singularities to destroy the course of history, and the mages he designated as his descendants (who could transform into Demon Gods at Goetia’s command) scattered throughout history to create seven detonation points. 
This was the cause of the collapse of the Foundation of Humanity in each era.  
Once the plot was realized, human history beyond the year 2018 vanished.

It was only after these achievements that his Class was determined.
“Grand Caster” was only a false rank.
He was created by man. A great catastrophe that effectively abused human history.

His name is Beast I.
He is one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and the Beast that possesses the principle of “pity.”
The arrogance of man taking pity on another and becoming disappointed.
Such is the bestial nature of Goetia.
