Winged Serpent.
The Noble Phantasm that makes her a Rider.
She summons and rides a quetzalcoatlus, a winged dragon from the Cretaceous period that was named after her.
It is actually a Phantasmal that is classified somewhere between a Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast, and is far more powerful than a real quetzalcoatlus.
The quetzalcoatlus is known as the largest winged animal in history.

When she unleashes its True Name, she gains the power to control storms and lightning over a huge area…
although it is not used in this game.
