### Bond 5

The reason she got into lucha libre is very simple.
She happened to see a match when summoned into the modern era, and the impact was so great that it affected even her original spirit in the Throne of Heroes.

“The body, yes! The use of weapons in a battle to the death should be avoided at all costs!
And lucha is best for a battle of wits, too, yes!”

Her favorite luchador is La Mistico.
As the goddess of wind, and the goddess of Venus, when she saw luchadores (or if they’re women, luchadoras) flying without wings, she was moved to tears, feeling she had seen the future.
After that, her studious nature and self-control quickly helped make her a lucha master.

She boasts that she could put any god or beast into a headlock if she wanted, but in order to spread the gospel of jump-based lucha, she doesn’t use any of the common lucha joint lock moves.
