### Bond 4

#### Christmas Tactics: EX

Quetzalcoatl is the soul of Lucha Libre, but at the same time also became the very epitome of Santa Claus. To resolve the contradiction between these two incompatible aspects, she developed a way of fighting in the lucha ring that maintains the style of Santa Claus. According to her, rather than using her usual aerial tactics, she employs “Christmas tactics.” She doesn’t fly through the air so much as through the concept of Christmas itself. They say that when this Santa Claus flies into the air, holy bells jingle three times, ringing across the wrestling mat that is the jungle.
