Love, Deliver to Children on the Holy Night.
“What’s that?” “It’s a star!” “It’s a colony!”
“No, it’s a Christmas present!”

It is Quetzalcoatl’s Santa Claus move, whereby she uses all her might to send the world’s children presents for Christmas. “Regalo de Navidad” is Spanish for “Christmas present.” It is also known as Yucatán Present Slam. Maybe this is because she unleashes her Noble Phantasm to the samba beat with such enthusiasm. In any case, what results is a ludicrously large present falling from low orbit.

The sheer size and impact force of this method of present delivery resemble the meteor said to have crashed into the Yucatán Peninsula in ancient times－one that is also said to have been the source of her Divinity. Of course, this present wouldn’t wipe out the dinosaurs, but is instead filled with all manner of things that will bring children joy.

Even if it’s unleashed when the villains (rudos) are in the ring, it would delight the children watching the match, so in the end, this Noble Phantasm exists only to bring happiness and smiles to the children of the world.
