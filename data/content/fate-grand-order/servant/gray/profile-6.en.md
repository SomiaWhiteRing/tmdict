### Bond 5

A certain clan once tried creating a vessel fit for a king. Her physical body is a faithful recreation of the ancient hero, and manifests power beyond the imagining of ordinary humans. However, these changes began occurring suddenly in Grayâ€™s youth, and so she has yet to accept this face she now wears as her own. She therefore has a strong bond with and sense of trust in Lord El-Melloi II, who took her from her homeland and has little care for her face.
