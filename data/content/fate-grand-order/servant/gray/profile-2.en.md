### Bond 2

For the most part, she is shy and withdrawn. Growing up in the countryside, so far from city life, gave her the tendency to stand back and observe events from some remove. Deep down, she is a gentle and patient person, and she has a tendency to behave in ways others find appealing, so she should be able to blend in under almost any circumstance given time.

â€¦As long as there is no mention of her face, that is. She and Add, who has a scathing, but honest tongue, make a great team.
