### Bond 4

Introverted, active.
A ditzy girl. No one is really sure what she’s thinking. She’s constantly hungry for love, and so she is a glutton who would devour everything around her.

Her personality is closest to her sister Passionlip (withdrawn, timid when outside her comfort zone), but since she has no sense of shame, she may appear forward or pushy. Though she may say little, she is like a big dog seeking communication and physical contact. Approaching her is like walking towards a bird that one thinks small and cute, only to realize the little bird is absolutely massive on getting closer…

Basically she is like a loyal giant robot…er, an obedient Servant. Since she craves love, wishes to be chosen, and wants to be treated kindly by others, she seeks interaction from Master subtly and silently.

Her dream is to become a cute bride. The terms “cute” and “bride” aren’t mutually exclusive to her. Rather, she thinks that cuteness is a given when one becomes a bride. It’s strange to think that she doesn’t associate cuteness with maintaining normal human size…
