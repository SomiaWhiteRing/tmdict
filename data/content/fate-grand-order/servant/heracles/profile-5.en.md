#### Twelve Labors (I)

In legends, Heracles was a hero who was given twelve labors, and conquered them all.
Those labors were all so difficult that ordinary heroes might be unable to finish just one. It is because of those merits that Heracles was able to ascend and join the gods as a constellation after death.
