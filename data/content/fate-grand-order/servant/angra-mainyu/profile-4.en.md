### Bond 4

After experiencing all the suffering that a man can experience, of course, the boy died. But his hatred towards this unfairness was burned into the walls of his stone prison, and he became a nameless ghost.
Long after the boy was gone, long after the people he hated were gone, long after the village itself was gone, he remained bound to the top of the mountain, watching the doings of mankind, their ugliness, and their joys.
A warm light. He thinks of the “normal days” he was never given, like a sage.
