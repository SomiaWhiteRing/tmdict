### Bond 3

Munenori’s foresight bordered on uncanny, and it is said that he was one of the first to recognize the incipient Shimabara Rebellion.
In the fourteenth year of the Kan’ei Era (1637), news of a Christian rebellion reached him. Munenori desperately tried to restrain Itakura Naizen-no-kami Shigemasa, who was ordered to lead a punitive attack. When Shogun Iemitsu asked him to explain his behavior, Munenori had only this to say: “Religious battles are always crucial. Lord Shigemasa is sure to die in battle.”
Things unfolded just as Munenori predicted. Shigemasa, as a daimyou earning only 15,000 koku, lacked the power needed to lead the western daimyo, and so he struggled in the attack. After learning of this dire situation, Shogun Iemitsu sent out his chief retainer, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, as commander-in-chief. However, Shigemasa panicked when he found out, and he charged into enemy territory before Nobutsuna arrived, and there met his end.
