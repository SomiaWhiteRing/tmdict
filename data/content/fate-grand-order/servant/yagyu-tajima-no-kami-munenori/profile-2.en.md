### Bond 2

A talented swordsman famously known as the son of Yagyu Sekishusai and the father of Yagyu Jubei.
During the Siege of Osaka in 1615, he successfully protected Shogun Hidetada, and it is said that he killed seven warriors in an instant.
After Munenori died, Shogun Iemitsu referred to him as the “Peerless Swordsman.”
He was both tactician and politician. He taught Shinkageryu to the nobility and to his disciples, and he sent his disciples out as instructors of swordsmanship to powerful feudal lords.
In period piece shows and novels, he is often depicted as an extraordinary conspirator. This is likely because the Yagyu clan’s social position was as high as a daimyou earning 12,500 koku of rice during the early Edo period, and it was highly unlikely that such position was earned through honest and innocent means.
