### Bond 5

Ionioi Hetairoi summons the entire army of Iskandar as they were in life. His bonds with his men cross over time itself, elevated to the level of a Noble Phantasm. This is a symbol of his kingship. This Noble Phantasm comes from the fact that in life he did not win his victories as a lone hero, but as the leader of an entire army.
