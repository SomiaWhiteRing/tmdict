Its proper name is the “Formation of Primordial Chaos”. It is not in Sima Yi’s nature to come up with cunning strategies. Whether it be during war or a power struggle, Sima Yi will position forces cleverly, will wait patiently, will win naturally, and will mutter some poetry that they detest while looking sullen.

When the illusory sun and moon appear from the horizon, the opponents will lose all advantage and instead have their hidden weaknesses exposed. As long as proper conditions align, such as if it is someone they have already defeated, or if the opponent’s data has already been collected, this Noble Phantasm becomes a devastating strategy that creates weaknesses in the user’s opponents.
