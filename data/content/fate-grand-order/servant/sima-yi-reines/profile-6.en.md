### Bond 5

Sima Yi was summoned as a result of Zhuge Liang having been summoned into Lord El-Melloi II. A sort of chain summoning, in essence… With the backing of Zhuge Liang’s Noble Phantasm Chu Shi Biao, “Dispatch Troops,” the chain summoning selected Sima Yi, who had ties to Zhuge Liang, and Reines, who had ties to El-Melloi II.

This is what brought Reines to Chaldea, and since she was the de facto Lord of the Clock Tower given a tremendous responsibility of her own, she is quite sympathetic to Master, who suddenly had the burden of being humanity’s last Master thrust upon them. She typically enjoys Master’s predicament, but when things are at their worst, Sima Yi’s abilities are sure to make her a truly powerful ally.
