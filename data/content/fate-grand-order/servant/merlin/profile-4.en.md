### Bond 4

A young man like the wind blowing across a grassy plain.
Everyone relaxes in his presence.
A good-looking, easygoing man with a good heart.
But he lacks a sense of responsibility and tends to be relaxed no matter the situation, so he is often seen as a shady con man.
He takes an objective view of things, and while he admits that the human world can be a cruel place,
he says, “Well that’s no fun, is it?” and changes the world into something happy.

He loves the world of mankind. He loves mischief. He loves girls.
The Mage of Flowers gets through most of his problems with a refreshing smile and a, “Now, now,” retort.

He’s often seen as a perfectly happy person, with no worries at all, but Merlin himself realizes that he is an outsider in human society, and so he can’t tear down the final barrier of being able to call someone a dear friend.
He watches over the world day and night so that humanity can have a happy ending.
