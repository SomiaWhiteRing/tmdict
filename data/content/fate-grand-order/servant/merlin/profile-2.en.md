### Bond 2

It’s said that while his mother was the princess of Wales, his father was an incubus, a supernatural being that lives between the Earth and the Moon.
He was a prophet from a young age.

The prophecy that brought him the greatest fame was that of a red dragon and a white dragon that slept beneath Mt. Erir, and how they would fight after they awoke.

“The red dragon represents Britain, and the white dragon the Saxons. Someday, Britain will gather power under the banner of a great king, and defeat the Gauls and Romans.”
These words were passed on through the ages as the prophecy of Merlin.
He left many other prophecies, some of which concerned even the outcome of wars and the deaths of kings.

Merlin aided Arthur’s father, Uther Pendragon, in his marriage to the queen, watching over the throne since before King Arthur’s birth.
In some versions of the story, he is like a foster father to Arthur, who watches over the young king’s growth and teaches him many things.
