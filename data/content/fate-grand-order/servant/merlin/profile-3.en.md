Eternally Secluded Utopia.
Merlin recreates the tower where he is still sealed away.
Flowers bloom on the ground, and warm sunlight pours into the surroundings, even in the darkest depths of hell.
Even if he were trapped in the smallest and darkest of cells, his only view a fragment of the sky far above, his utopia would continue to manifest.

The place where Merlin, the Mage of Flowers, dwells will never be a hell.
It will be a land filled with hope.

#### Illusion: A

Magecraft that deceives others.
Refers to mental interference and false images projected into the real world.
At A rank, it can create not only nightmares within the world of the mind, but in the real world as well. It could easily create false images powerful enough to affect an entire village.
