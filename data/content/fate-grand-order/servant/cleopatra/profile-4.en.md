### Bond 4

In her life, Cleopatra loved two men.
The first was Caesar. She was clearly deeply in love with him. Her passion and feelings made even the Mediterranean breeze seem to sparkleâ€¦
But then he died, leaving behind his son Caesarion. 
He was assassinated, just before he could unite the Mediterranean nations.

As she cried, another man appeared before her. He was the Roman general Marcus Antonius, the man who declared he would protect Cleopatra and the Ptolemaic Egypt.

She loved her country and its people, as well as the two men Marcus Antonius and Julius Caesar. And in the end, she took her own life.
