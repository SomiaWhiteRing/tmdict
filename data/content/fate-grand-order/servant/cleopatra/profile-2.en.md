### Bond 2

In public, she acts arrogant, as befits a queen. 
But in private she is much calmer, in control of her emotions as a well-raised, thoughtful lady.
She could be described as a high-handed, sadistic sweetheart.
Although she is a sadist, it does not mean that she takes pleasure in tormenting others.
She doesnâ€™t insult them because she enjoys it, but simply because it is part of her personality.
