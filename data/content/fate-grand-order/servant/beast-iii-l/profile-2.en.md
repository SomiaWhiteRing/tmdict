### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue」

Kama/Mara is compatible with the emotion of love, but she is multifaceted and also carries the opposite aspects of negativity. Her existence was unstable to begin with, but her divine core　mixed with love and suffering and the vessel’s destiny synched up, resulting in her gaining a more stable Spirit Origin. Typically the ratio of Kama to Mara is about 6:4. Much like other Divine Spirit Servants such as Ishtar, the vessel’s characteristics (personality and disposition) are retained, but not their persona (record).
