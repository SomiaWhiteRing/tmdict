### Bond 4

The instant the technique is unleashed, all three thrusts exist in the same place and at the same time.
Even if the opponent can block the First Thrust, the Second Thrust and the Third Thrust will pierce through the defense.
And for this paradox, an Event Saturation Phenomenon will occur at the tip of the sword, making this technique quite literally unblockable.
Through proper application of the Event Saturation Phenomenon, this attack is good at destroying matters as well.
