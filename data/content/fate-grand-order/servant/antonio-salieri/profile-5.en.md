### Bond 5

Antonio Salieri was Amadeus Mozart’s friend.

Normally, he would not have been recorded on the Throne as an Anti-Hero. Though he lost his position at court, he was still a respected musician who took many other musicians and their children as disciples. His group of pupils included Süssmayr (Mozart’s best disciple), Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (Mozart’s son), and even Beethoven.

However, around 1820, a rumor took hold around the world that Salieri had murdered Mozart. Though there was no truth to the rumor, people began envisioning a tragic story of a genius beloved by God and a talented prodigy jealous enough to kill. Even when an aged Salieri once told his pupil Moscheles that such rumors were “malicious slander and nothing else,” this was taken to be a confession of his crime. There were even rumors that Salieri, overcome with regret in his old age, went on to slash his own throat.
