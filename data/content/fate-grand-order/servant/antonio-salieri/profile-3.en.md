### Bond 3

#### Innocent Monster: EX

Salieri never killed anyone during his lifetime. However, rumors of his assassination of Mozart eventually spread around the world, so he had little choice but to become an Innocent Monster. This skill is combined with Self-Denial, normally a stand-alone skill, to become a kind of compound skill.

#### Lamenting Exterior: A

Salieri puts forward the face of an Anti-Hero. This is because his ability stems from his synchronizing with another being, the Man in Grey, who is famously depicted as appearing before Mozart and commissioning him to write his Requiem in July of 1791. In battle, Salieri automatically dons this facade and behaves like an agent of slaughter.

#### Wildfire: B

As with any rumor, the legends of Mozart’s assassination spread like wildfire. Avenger Salieri is perhaps the embodiment of all mankind’s malice, slander, rumor, demagoguery, and horrible whispers, all of which serve to give him his power as well.
This skill not only instantly weakens the minds of his targets, but also functions as an intense mental attack. Unless his target has defenses on par with magecraft, he may drive them to suicide.
