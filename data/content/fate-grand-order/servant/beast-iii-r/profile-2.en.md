### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

#### Multi-Colored Tranquility: EX

A belief outside Buddhist teachings that Kiara used in a certain digital world.
It was a medical software program intended to separate an individual’s body, mind, and soul to lay the soul bare (to strip it of the body and mind’s protection), then the therapist could listen to the individual’s troubles and heal their suffering.
Obviously, this was simply a front.
Bereft of its protection, the defenseless soul is separated from the bonds of the body and mind, and absorbed into Kiara. Kiara savors her victim’s soul all while claiming she has done so in the name of providing salvation. It is the ultimate version of Charm, the power of absolute, implicit trust. By becoming a Beast, her powers have increased tremendously.

Wearing the crown of a Beast, or Mara, which is an obstacle for Buddhist practice, Kiara’s beauty as the Demonic Bodhisattva shatters the sanity, reasoning, and morality of any who lay eyes on her. The moment an individual lays eyes on Kiara, they must make a sanity check—a SAN save, or “Kiara save”—to determine whether they retain their sanity and sense of self. If successful, vision, taste, hearing, smell, and sensation are all preserved. However, the moment they think of Kiara as beautiful, all is lost. When this happens, all sense of self is gone, and after a brief bout of dizziness, one’s sense of equilibrium and reality simply evaporates. They are then doomed to become one of Kiara’s many followers, already held within her palm.
