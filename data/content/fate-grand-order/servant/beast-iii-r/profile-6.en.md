### Clear Main Quest 「Epilogue: Palladion That Tears Through Time (2/2)」

Love is a good thing. And greed is a good thing.
But when love becomes greed for pleasure, it ceases to be good. Love and greed should always be separate. But when the soul of the savior who loved and wished to please humanity gained the Third Magic, Sessyoin Kiara became something inhuman. All living things in the world could be saved through pleasure, and so she pursued the ultimate salvation in an effort to become the recipient of such pleasure. Seven billion lives were gathered into herself, used solely so that she might reach her climax. Without peering into the future, without ever imagining an end to her delight, she simply tried to save humanity with pleasure alone. 

Ruled as she was by such desires, her class was determined. “Deity of pleasure” is simply a false address. She is the greatest calamity that tried to save humanity in an earnest quickie, relying on the twisted conclusion she reached herself. She is Beast III/R, one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and the Beast associated with sexual desire.
