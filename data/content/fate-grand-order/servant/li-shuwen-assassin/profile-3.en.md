### Bond 3

Though he is summoned as an Assassin, he doesnâ€™t kill for a living, and he prefers a fair fight. He finds the life of an assassin does not sit particularly well with him, though he feels no embarrassment or shame. Should Master be in a dangerous situation, however, he will not hesitate to stoop to assassination.
