### Bond 4

#### Can’t Be Helped: A-

This skill is a double-edged sword, burning the body up in exchange for a powerful release of magical energy. Did this judgment of their own fate disappear among the flames, or did it…?

#### It Is But a Dream: B

The existence of Demon King Nobunaga is a hollow one, due to the Counter Force constantly working against their powerful and heterogeneous state, which makes their Spirit Origin hazy and undefined as well.

#### Demon King of the Sixth Heaven: EX

A monster whose past was distorted by their reputation in life. Those who possess this skill will change their abilities and appearance. It is very much like the Innocent Monster skill. This is a skill that points to Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, an entity completely different than the Demon King Mara from Buddhism.
