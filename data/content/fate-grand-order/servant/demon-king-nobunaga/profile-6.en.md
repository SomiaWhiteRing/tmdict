### Bond 5

Demon King Nobunaga. The Nobunaga who is the furthest from all possible Nobunagas, and closest to the abyss. As the self-proclaimed Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, they bear all the fear and reverence directed at the name Nobunaga across all ages, leading them to be reborn as the terribly powerful, but hollow, true demon king.

However, they do not fundamentally deny gods or Buddhas, but rather represent Nobunaga’s belief that human potential should be in human hands alone, while gods and Buddhas should be respected but never relied on… “Actually, there’s no way I’d ever be divine.”

In other words, this is a so-called Innocent Monster, but the life of the Demon King Nobunaga as an Anti-Hero, so prominently seen as an enemy of the gods and Buddha is more akin to that of a demon who is really an ally to Buddhism.

“I am the Demon King Nobunaga… I have surpassed the Realm of Desire and reborn as the enemy of gods, Buddha, and all living beings.”

Another thing to note is that the “Demon King Nobunaga” is not the ultimate Nobunaga. While it is one of the strongest forms born from the story of Nobunaga, they are in no way ultimate, but rather they are the manifestation furthest from the truth… They are simply a flame in human form, burning furiously beyond the oblivion.
