### Bond 5

#### Demonic Nature of Oni: A

A skill that displays an oni’s ability and demonic nature.
Originally a skill that combined aspects of Natural Demon, Monstrous Strength, Charisma, and Mana Burst, but in this iteration, the skill has been adjusted to match the context of the game.
In most cases, Mana Burst will manifest with the attribute of “heat,” but in Ibaraki’s case, her Mana Burst’s attribute is “flame.”
