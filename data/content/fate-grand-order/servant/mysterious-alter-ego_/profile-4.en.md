### Bond 4

#### Swan Lake: A

Crime Ballet has transformed due to her Sadistic Nature skill being suppressed. In exchange for her ATK and Evade weakening, she has turned into a dancer even more enthralling and more beautiful to her audience.
There may be an opportunity for her to pull off the “ultimate triple axel” one day.

#### Complete Fluidity: B

An Authority of Leviathan. They will fill the world with sea water by turning themselves into a fluid being. The only thing that could defeat Melt in this form would be an Ignore Invincible attack.

#### Melt Envy: EX

Contamination due to Envy, one of the seven deadly sins. Leviathan caused her Melt Virus skill to change. This skill steals the magical energy from other party members to increase her own NP Strength. At first glance it may seem a powerful skill, but it’s actually quite the evil tactic that tends to mess with a party’s cohesion.
