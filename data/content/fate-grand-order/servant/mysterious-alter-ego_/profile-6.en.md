### Bond 5

Leviathan is the Demonic Beast that lives in the sea, mentioned in the Book of Job in the Old Testament. After the Final Judgment, God created a giant Demonic Beast that would become food for humanity, which is how the Demonic Beasts Behemoth of the land and Leviathan (Livyatan) of the sea were created.

Leviathan and Behemoth are said to be a pair, where Behemoth is the mild-mannered herbivore and Leviathan the violent carnivore.

All Leviathans are said to be female, and they are usually depicted as giant serpents. During the Middle Ages, the sea was perceived as a place of death, and its violent nature soon led people to think of it as the devil, ultimately leading it to represent one of the seven deadly sins: envy.

In demonology, Leviathan holds a position next to Satan and Beelzebub, as well as having Authority as a Great Admiral of hell’s navy. In the Book of Job, it is said that its massive body would cause the sea to whirl and induce raging waves just by swimming.

“No matter how violent they are, as long as they have Divinity, that’ll make them goddesses if they’re female☆”

…At least, that’s BB’s off-the-wall interpretation.
