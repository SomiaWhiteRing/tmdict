### Bond 5

#### Sabotage: B

A capable scout’s skill.
The ability to find blind spots and weaknesses in an enemy’s attack and positioning, reducing their combat effectiveness. The same as Fuuma Kotarou’s Sabotage skill.

#### Messenger of the Galaxy: EX

A skill based on the story that she crossed a frigid river in order to deliver important dispatches.
It decreases the enemy’s morale while increasing her allies’ morale.
However, because the validity of her tale is uncertain, it’s probability-based when applied to allies. (Since she believes in herself, Jane herself will power up without fail.)

#### O Polar Star, Shine My Way: B

The minimized version of her Noble Phantasm that she no longer uses.
It’s a unique skill where its effect proportionally increases based on the amount of Critical Stars available.
It’s a Noble Phantasm that originally carried a single ray of hope intended for a comeback against next-dimensional threats that humanity cannot possibly beat on its own.
