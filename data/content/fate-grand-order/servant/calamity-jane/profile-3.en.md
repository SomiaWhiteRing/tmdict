### Bond 3

She is the life of the party, always cheering for others rather than elevating herself.
Her extreme optimism enables her to always believe there is a future. Even if the existence of space itself is at stake, she never loses hope, and she will stubbornly believe in its survival.
While her intentions are all good, the actions she takes really make one question her aims. She’s the kind of person who would demolish a house to get needed building materials for a bridge on the brink of collapse.

She is never critical of others, preferring to sing the praises of their accomplishments, big or small. This is why she gets along with Space Ishtar, who often gets carried away…er, is someone who works hard after a bit of encouragement. She is a competent space scout, and her survival skills are second to none.
However, she has zero life skills.
Against targets not within her line of sight, she has high spec sabotage and disruption capacity, but her combat abilities drastically decrease against direct targets.
