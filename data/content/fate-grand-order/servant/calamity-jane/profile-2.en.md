### Bond 2

A scout and gunman from America’s frontier days.
While technically not an outlaw, her supposed accomplishments were either exaggerated or of dubious merit, and in her life she was both praised and criticized. Her uncertain background is the reason why most of her skills are debuff types, despite her optimistic personality.

Her name itself means disaster, and she lived through the same period as Billy the Kid during America’s Wild West. She was an expert gunman, a brilliant scout, the lover of Wild Bill Hickok, who was called the “Champion of the Plains,” and as she and Hickok fought through countless deadly campaigns, she herself was given the nickname “Queen of the Plains.”

There are two theories about how she became known as Calamity. The first is based on the legend of her being a savior from calamity, in which it is said that she saved a group of cavalrymen from an ambush by Native Americans. The other is based on her being called the “woman who brings forth calamity,” which purports that all her lovers were killed in battle. Some also suggest both are true.
