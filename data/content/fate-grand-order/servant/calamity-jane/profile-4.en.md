The Black Hand That Invites Death.
“Bad Luck” is engraved on a bullet and shot toward the back of a target’s head.
Even if the shot is fired at point-blank range, the bullet will always loop around to the target’s back.
This special attack is said to induce a vision of a pair black aces and black eights, the same way her lover and comrade, the Champion of the Plains, Wild Bill Hickok, died.
According to history, Wild Bill was playing a hand of poker at a saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota, when he was shot and killed by Jack McCall from behind. At the time of his assassination, Wild Bill was said to be holding a two-pair hand of black aces and eights, which has since become widely known as the “dead man’s hand.”
