Tenkiame.
Its proper name is “Monjuchiken Daitouren.”
Her beloved sword Daitouren possesses the divine power to split into a maximum of 250 swords and rain down mercilessly upon her enemies.
In life, she could combine her own sword with its counterpart, her husband’s sword Sohayamaru, to create a storm of 500 swords.
Now, her favorite hairpin takes the place of Sohayamaru. The hairpin touches Daitouren as it hovers in the sky, triggering the Tenkiame. It’s not the most accurate attack, but when her skill “Blessings of Talent” is active, she gains much more exact control, becoming able to perform feats such as making swords rain all around her without harming herself.
