### Clear Interlude 「A High School Girl Stroll in Chaldea」

Perhaps because her wish to spend her life with someone who loved her back was never fulfilled during her lifetime, Suzuka Gozen manifested here and wished upon the Holy Grail for love. She lives for love, and will die for love. On top of that, her pride in being regarded as a beauty has made her vain. As such, when she was summoned to this world as a Servant, she did a little digging in the history of the early 2000s and learned that high school girls were popular and considered to be highly beautiful during that time. These girls (at first glance) looked like they were having so much fun that Suzuka Gozen, enthralled by their way of life, immediately decided to adopt their style. While her style was born from a slight misunderstanding, Suzuka Gozen at least seems to like it.

“Since I’ve become a like, totes amazing high school girl, I should show hella pride in repping my fam. I can seem like, max calculating and it’s cool, ’cuz it’d just SUPER embarrass girls everywhere if I was all worried about being the winner and stuff.”

There you have it. Looks like she completely respects high school girls from the bottom of her heart.
Seems like she takes everything very seriously.
