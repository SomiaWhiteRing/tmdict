### Clear Main Quest 「The Crimson Beauty under the Moon」

Stories describing Xiang Yu had been passed down throughout the ages as a prodigical yet foolilsh conqueror. Yet his true character was not something that could be described by laymen in the first place.

He was a cyborg based on Nezha’s remains, which were found and collected during Qin Shi Huang’s travels in search of the sage world. Xiang Liang, after seizing the cyborg, claimed him as his nephew Xiang Ji.
Even after Xiang Liang’s death, he remained as artificial intelligence driven to execute his initial purpose…the swift actualization of peace reiging the land. However, his methodology in reaching said goals completely deviated from human morality.

In order for the next leadership to swiftly rise to power, he executed devastation and massacre for the purpose of simplifying and narrowing the Chinese strategical map. From a logical point of view, his actions were nothing but futile tyranny executed by a demonic king.
But in the end, the turmulous Chu-Han contention lasted only four years, and Liu Bang, who was just one of the many minor officers, managed to elevate himself to become the Gaozu (High Founder) of the Han Dynasty.
