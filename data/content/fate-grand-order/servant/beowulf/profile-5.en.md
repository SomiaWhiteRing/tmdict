### Bond 5

Some scholars propose that the name Beowulf actually came from “Bee-wulf,” which means a bee-hunting wolf, synonym for bear.
According to literature, Beowulf’s name may share the same origin as the Norse berserkers, as the word berserker is literally rendered as “bear-coats” in Old Norse.
Wearing bear coats, Norse berserkers ravaged the battlefields with their ferocity, while Beowulf tore Grendel’s arm into pieces with his bare hands like a savage bear.
Even in his older days, the wise Beowulf slayed the evil dragon while maintaining his sanity.
A Berserker that kept the ferocity of his younger days and the wisdom of his older days. That’s the kind of Servant Beowulf is.
