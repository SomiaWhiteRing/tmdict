### Bond 3

#### Riding Skill: EX

The ability to ride various mounts. However, the moment he manifested as a man-horse(?) Rider, thereâ€™s really not much need for additional Riding abilities.

#### Running a Thousand Li (Horse): EX

Boundless energy that allows him to travel for long periods of time and over great distances. The skill is also effective in temporarily raising AGI parameters or increasing END and STR parameters when sprinting.
