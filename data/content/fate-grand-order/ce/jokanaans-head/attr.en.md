A mountain of skulls…
Crystal skulls.
Heroic Spirit Salome’s Noble Phantasm.
Amazing skulls that enable her to use magecraft even without magical circuits.

Salome speaks.
She whispers to you.
She tells you that the pile of skulls are all of Jokanaan’s head, her eternal beloved.

But that’s strange…
There should only have been one John the Immerser. So the first skull should only be of Jokanaan, or John’s head. What about those other skulls, then?

Unless, those are all the heads of past Masters who successfully summoned her…?
