If you want to run towards the horizon, then let nothing bind you.
Reason, common sense, old traditionsâ€¦
These are shackles that bind your heart.
So cut them. Overturn them.
A single flash of a blade can turn a foolish deed into a great one.
The sign of rulership you showed here shall be your guide to the next world.
