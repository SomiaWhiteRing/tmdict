A return gift from Aśvatthāman.

The gift is no physical item. Instead, he takes time to speak to you and get to know you better and to let you know him better…as a Heroic Spirit, a leader, and a Servant.

That fact alone is precious enough, as it means he is trying to open up to you.

Now to converse. The night is long, and there is still so much to talk about.
