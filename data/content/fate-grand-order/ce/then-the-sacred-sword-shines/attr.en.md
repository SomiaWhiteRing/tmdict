February, 1991.
The Tokyo Holy Grail War.
Many heroes were lost, and many tears were shed.

The Lesser Grail is filling up with souls. And the sixth Beast quickens inside the Underground Greater Grail that nurtures it. With the world’s end near and her love approaching fulfillment, the girl smirks.

But…somewhere…

The King of Knights who finds resolution from a small ray of light…finally unsheaths the sacred sword.
