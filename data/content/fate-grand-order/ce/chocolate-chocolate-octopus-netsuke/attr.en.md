A netsuke-style chocolate from Katsushika Hokusai (Saber).

They are shaped like the characters found in one of the yomi-hon that Hokusai’s daughter Oei (Oui) likely preferred to read, titled “Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki.” They are also delicately engraved with images of Toto-sama and members of Chaldea.

“Th-th-th-th…this ain’t for that ’Valentine’s Day’ thingy! I-I’m just sharin’ some food with ya! It’s just me appreciating everything you’ve done…I mean…I want to thank ya… Just quit starin’ at it! Hurry up and eat it!”
