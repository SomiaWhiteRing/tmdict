Return item bestowed by Qin Shi Huang.

It’s basically a Valentine’s Day return gift.

A piece of chalcedony carved to look like a gâteau au chocolat. Its intricate workmanship looks like the real thing, and is on par with other famous Chinese treasures such as the jadeite cabbage or meat-shaped stone.
