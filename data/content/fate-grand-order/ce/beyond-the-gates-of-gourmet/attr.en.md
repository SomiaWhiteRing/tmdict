And so, the nameless NEET becomes a hero who saves the world, thanks to the power of a god! Hmmm, well this whole reincarnating into a different world thing went a little too far, and honestly, the plot device of the grown-up me having an arc of self-realization and improvement is kind of heavy and a huuuge drag!

But as you can see, I’ve now become a mature person who can not only save others, but myself as well! I guess Ganesha wanted to point out that every human has a role in this world.

Our journey still continues, so no more gloomy talk. I may just be a Pseudo-Servant, but I’m still a god of fortune, so I’ll dish out a bunch of peace and prosperity for your family, business, and all around luck!

Okay, see here, even if I’m not a rare type of character, I still gotta eat the premium stuff!
