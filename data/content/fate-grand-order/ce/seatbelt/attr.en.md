Gift from Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II.

A seatbelt that will be needed when Mk.II finds the Megaframe.
Despite its appearance, the silver-colored belt is made with pure leather, and the rows of screws were designed with the pilot’s safety in mind. It’s a little prickly.

“…It looks good on you…more than I imagined. Even I have no complaints. Next up…let’s see… Maybe I’ll prepare a silvery rubber suit for you.”
