The forbidden fruit of the Gods, causing men’s rationality to fade, yet promises them immortality.

Any human being would stop, reach for the fruit, and try to eat it. This is a conditioned response, similar to how you will retract your hand when touching something hot, a response carved deeply into our body.

A long time ago, during a race, someone used this on me and I had stopped, losing control over myself. I really don’t want to remember what happened after.

And that’s precisely why I won’t give this to you.
…because, you have no need of something like this.
Isn’t that right?
