A slice of life, animal-fantasy manga. In this story, anthropomorphized animals live in the fantasy setting of Chaldea Land.

A rabbit mommy and a fox mommy. A bear daddy, and a cat daughter. They make one happy family and spend their heartwarming days together. It sounds a bit like a nursery tale.

A travelling platypus named Merlin, and a hunter raccoon named Arash also make appearances.

As a side note, the daughter Jack is actually a human who reincarnated from a different world. The moment she arrived in Chaldea Land, she turned into a girl of the cat clan.
