He said that photographs were his hobby.
That they were a tool to record a world, a grand landscape that’s beyond imagination.
He laughed to hide his embarrassment, and then showed me all of the pictures he had taken and saved.
A sleeping cat, a ship, his room during Halloween, and of course, all the workers in Chaldea.
Common, everyday landscapes and people.
For that is what he left behind in those precious photos of his…
the beautiful world that can be seen all around us.
