Valentine’s Day chocolate from Kingprotea.

It’s a typical heart-shaped chocolate, but as you can see…it’s gigantic, over a hundred meters tall. As she was unable to procure any ingredients other than chocolate (no appropriately sized fruits exist), the design may be simple, but her sentiments are clearly communicated.

So why is this happening at the beach, you ask?
Because Protea’s dream is to have a house with a pool near the beach.
