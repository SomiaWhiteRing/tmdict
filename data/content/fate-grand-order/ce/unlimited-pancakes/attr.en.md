“Sweet confections are a symbol of friendship.
Most people can’t be angry or sad while eating them.”

<>

“Oh my! My, my, my, my, my!”

The little witch cried out in delight while reading an ordinary recipe book.
For she saw an ordinary truth, and it started to take form as a spell for her.

“How wonderful!
How true!
People fight because there aren’t enough sweet things!
They’re upset because there are only a finite number of pancakes!”
With that thought, doom was unleashed.
There was no goddess or other witch nearby to stop her.
She took her favorite staff, and attempted to summon an infinite amount of ingredients.
It goes without saying that this resulted in trouble.
The little witch caused havoc that was, shall we say, first class and well beyond her powers☆
