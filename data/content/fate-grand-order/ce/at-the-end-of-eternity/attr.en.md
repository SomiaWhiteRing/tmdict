A sword said to be wielded by a nameless Heroic Spirit.

She split off from a certain Heroic Spirit, and was tasked to fight for eternity as a Guardian for humans.
It is not known whether this fate was a curse or if it was indeed her wish.

Whatever the case, it seems like she was enjoying herself despite the endless battle. She must have been, since she liked to give names to attacks she claimed to be ultimate moves. But come on, show some mercy to the one always by her side. Quit throwing me!

Speaking as the one who she’s wielded, and who has been by her side for so long now, I once accidentally asked if she ever got tired of all this.
Her completely serious, even deadpan response was, “Are you tired of it?” I was about to say that I was actually getting sick of it, but when she started to look sad, I said, “Not really,” without thinking. Crap.

“At the edge of distant time, the gods, demons, and human prayers all intertwined to create this fragment of light. It stands here, in the land of eternity.”
