A superstructure (giant mech) is proof of one’s status as a guardian god.
The body itself is the true form of Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II! In other words, it’s a gigantic Mecha Eli-chan…!
She reaches a height of 57 meters.
She absolutely refuses to be weighed.
Since she devours a massive amount of magical energy, one of her flaws is that she can only be useful as a defense emplacement.
She claims that she is not embarrassed people can see up her skirt, since she’s a mech.

“It’s true that it’s only around to rule Csejte, but I don’t mind you driving it around whenever you like since you became the official pilot.
Now that that’s settled, go ahead and get in.
I don’t mind. I’ll make sure to drain your magical energy dry, too. You think you can run away? You know very well how far my hands can reach, right?”
