“Wonderful and Congratulations, Illya! At last, you’ve completed the full set of Class Cards! From now on, you can do as many Phantasmal Summons (Installs) as you want!”
“T-That’s great, but when did you…? Ruby, you stole the enemy drops without permission, didn’t you…”
“Hey! Not another word about Ruby-chan’s side business!☆”
“You dumb stick! Let’s go apologize together!”

(Well, between you and me, I had to make all kinds of shady deals with the people who had tool creation skills in order to repair the sealed cards, but there’s no need to talk about that.☆)

“But… does that mean I can help Master even more now?”
“Of course! I’ve borrowed the power of all the different Heroic Spirits we met at Chaldea to bring out the unlimited power of your obnoxious – I mean, happy possibilities and transformation forms! In addition to the seven base classes, I’ve also added Ruler, Shielder, Avenger, Swimsuiter, Trick or Treater, Perverter, Dangerous Beaster, and…”
“Those last ones are weird! Those aren’t even classes! Anyway, I’m going to do my best so Master can count on me… but… Nothing too embarrassing, okay?”
