Valentine’s return gift from Beowulf.

“I’m gonna be dragon steeeak!”
And now you are.

For seasoning: soy sauce and wasabi for a Japanese-style taste, and onion sauce to give it a Western flavor.
It’s not fatty at all, and you can enjoy its true meaty taste.
It doesn’t actually taste like beef, though. In fact, it tastes more like chicken.
According to restaurant reviews, the store is famous for its “scary owner.”
