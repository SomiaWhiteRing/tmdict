…Master.
Eat some salmon.
It will make you smarter.

Of course, it won’t give you infinite wisdom.
It’s only a rainbow scale salmon.
However, it seems that salmon fat contains properties to increase one’s concentration, so it’s not entirely a waste of time.

Strength alone or beauty alone are not enough.
You must be more clever.
If you stumble and fall…it is good to have the kind of wisdom that lets you look back and learn from your failure.

Mmm?
You say that having wisdom means you should act in a way that doesn’t lead to failure?
Heh.
Certainly.
Ideally, that is the case!

But people make mistakes.
They do not always choose the correct path.

Therefore, here.
You should eat salmon, too.
