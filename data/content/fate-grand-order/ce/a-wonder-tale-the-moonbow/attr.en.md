A Wonder Tale: The Moonbow.

Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki.
A yomi-hon written by Kyokutei Bakin, known for the epic novel “Nansou Satomi Hakkenden.” Katsushika Hokusai worked on the illustrations, and it was extremely popular among readers in Edo.

Hokusai’s daughter Oei (Oui) was dexterous with her hands, and she often made and sold clothing for small wooden dolls called keshi-ningyou (or mame-ningyou). Young Oei immersed herself in these yomi-hon, and she may have created keshi-ningyou modeled after Minamoto-no-Tametomo, the hero of the Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki, or even the fairy of the dragon palace from the yomi-hon titled “Kinkasekiei,” which were illustrated by Hokusai’s disciple, Katsushika Hokusuu.
