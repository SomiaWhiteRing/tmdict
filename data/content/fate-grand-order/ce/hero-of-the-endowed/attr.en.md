Let us give our treasure.
Let us entrust our power.
Let us bestow everything.

After I’ve been given everything, after I’ve ruined everything, then I finally realized.
What I truly wanted in life, wasn’t something like this.

That’s why, in order to grasp what I really want in life, I am risking everything I have.
The life that everyone else cherished so much, I am going to risk like a chip on the betting table.

To be honest.
This is the best feeling in the world!
