In the twinkling night, numerous blessings rain down upon us.

For you, who wishes to nurture your love with your beloved.
For you, who wishes to strengthen your friendship with others.
For you, who wishes to deepen your bond with your family.

And for you, who continues to fight for the sake of others.

Everyoneâ€™s wishes are equal.
That is what each and every Santa Claus believes.
