In the Age of Gods, where man’s domain was still limited, a king gathered all the treasure across all the lands and stored them inside a vault he had built.

Those were known as the origins of all treasures that followed.
The evidence of all mankind’s wisdom and knowledge.
People started to praise it as the “Gate of the Gods.”
Truly, it is.
Eventually, the “vault” itself became a Mystic more mysterious than the treasures it held.

Also, the key to the vault can only be used by the King.
The key will constantly change its shape, and the vault will constantly store new treasures.
Without the wisdom to instantly understand those Mystics, the key will never be able to open the vault’s gate.
