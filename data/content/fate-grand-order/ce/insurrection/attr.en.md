A somber moment begins.
The screams of the crowd. Their insults. Their cheers…
Ignore them and focus on your “comrade” before you.
A hungry lion bares its fangs.
Its hunger has made it dangerous, and you hear it has already devoured three men.
Both he and you must kill or be killed.
That’s why the beast’s death was certain.
…How sad.
You tyrants who would toy with the lives of man and beast, your hour shall come.
For I, Spartacus, swear I shall deal you a fatal blow!
