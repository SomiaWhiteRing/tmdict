A King is not born in the human world, but is sent from Heaven.
Kings born this way are said to possess the divine right to become the Holy King.

A natural ruler, the pure, young king shines like the sun.
That Holy King is the embodiment of an ideal.

However, he does not yet know what must be offered up in the name of that ideal.
