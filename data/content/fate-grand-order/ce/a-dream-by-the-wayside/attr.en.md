“Hello,” someone said, speaking earnestly to one who didn’t exist.

The stone by the wayside remembers.
Whether that miracle disappears into the shadows, becomes an illusion, or is ultimately recorded as nothing at all, it remembers the cozy moments. A warm time shared in the infirmary, which should have been empty after the end of the school day.

…Just thinking back now makes my heart yearn.
A story of love that was simply too young, in a far-off phenomenon.
