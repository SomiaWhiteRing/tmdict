Valentine’s chocolate from Osakabehime.

I put so much thought into this. I thought really hard.
I racked my brains thinking of a killer expression that would move you to your core and sweet nothings that would melt your heart.

But…they all sounded fake and just kinda…ordinary.
And after getting jealous of everyone else’s chocolates and gifts, I ended up with this.

But to see you so happily eat my unoriginal chocolate is a memory that I’m going to cherish.
