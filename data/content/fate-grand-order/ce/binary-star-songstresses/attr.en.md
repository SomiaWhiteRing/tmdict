We shall sing…
To you, who walks out into the twilight…

We shall sing…
To you, who welcomes daybreak…

Our song and voice shall guide you so you will neither stray nor waver from your path.

Let us sing, let us sing, let us sing.
For there are sure to be wonderful encounters.

Why, of course that something wonderful is for “me,” you know?
