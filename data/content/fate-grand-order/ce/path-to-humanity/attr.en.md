All living things are the product of miracles.
Therefore, the act of creating life is sacred, and it is without a doubt an act of God.
And if it is giving life to something as complex as a human being, that would be none other than the most sacred of all acts.

But what happens here will violate that notion.
With wisdom, science, and the power of magecraft, I will bring a miracle into this world!

â€¦The fool forgot one thing.
That miracle could not possibly turn out something wonderful.
