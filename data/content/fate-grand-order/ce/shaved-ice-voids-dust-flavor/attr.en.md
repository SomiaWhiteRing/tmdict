Another midsummer seaside pleasure.
Gather pieces of cold ice, pour on a special syrup, and you can enjoy the flavor of summer.

“So this must be what’s called experimental cuisine. Of course, I wouldn’t dare use shadow Servants as ingredients, only something similar. But don’t worry, with my Alchemy techniques, you won’t even be able to tell the difference. Please try it. It’ll just taste like grape.
Just keep in mind that the syrup is homemade. I’d love to gather some data on this.”
