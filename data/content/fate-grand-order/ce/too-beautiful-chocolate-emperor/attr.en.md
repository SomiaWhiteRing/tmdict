Valentine’s chocolate from Nero (Caster).

A chocolate inspired by the statue of Venus found in the Golden Theater by the sea. It is an intricately carved masterpiece in both design and taste. Why is it a statue of a winged Venus? Nero herself doesn’t know. She says it just came to her.

“Umu. I initially intended to design a cute mascot, but the next thing I knew, I’d made this! Love it! Cherish it as if it were me!”
