A fragile pig destined to become ground meat, and the kind-hearted spider she befriended.

Is it right to turn a cute pig like her into sausage? Of course not.

The spider decides to defy fate by rebelling against humanity. Suck the blood of the farmers. Burn the shed down.

“Words are useless if scum like you are destined to die anyway.”
