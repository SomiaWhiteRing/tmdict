Cut ties to the ordinary world, praise desire as one living, aim for infinity as a swordsman.
I have long forgot my own age, and I have long lost my own image.

Training is my ordinary.
Tirelessly, continuously, endlessly.
Before my end, I walked out into the woods and took a breath.

â€¦His blade has finally reached the hollow moon.
