A beautiful white horse…
Once, it was a dragon, but it changed its form to become the steed of a noble monk.

It is said that it’s the child of the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas.
It carries the blood of the dragon king who rules all water in its veins, and has power beyond human comprehension.

The white horse travels with the priestess on her journey, just as it did in the past so many years ago, and so far away.

The protection of the four noble gods who defend Buddhism is with her – even if they have lost their shape!
