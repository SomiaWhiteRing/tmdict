The Universe Rings, like the Red Armillary Sash, are one of the famed Baobei of Jinguangdong. It was a Taoist weapon that was presented by Taiyi Zhenren to celebrate Nezha’s birth. Since then, Nezha always carried it with her.

The weapon can expand and contract at will. They are usually worn around the wrist as a pair of bracelets, but they quickly turn into a pair of circular blades the moment they leave the body. Nezha uses this weapon like a semi-autonomous drone.
When she throws them up in the air and shouts “Jí (speed)!” the Rings shoot towards the enemy. When she shouts “Tíng (stay)!” they stop in mid-air, and they return to her hand when she shouts “Lái (come)!”

But there was a time when Nezha didn’t carry the Universe Rings.
They were taken from her in the battle against Lady Rock, and later retrieved by Taiyi Zhenren, who kept them temporarily.
From the time of Nezha’s suicide to save her human parents and atone for her sins until her rebirth, they were out of her possession.
To Nezha, this Baobei is closely associated with humiliating and regrettable memories. Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.

If there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself. And it would also represent a vow that she will always resurrect and come back to the holder, no matter what.
