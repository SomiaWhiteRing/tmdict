Magifender of Oni?
Oh that’s right. That’s what we went with.
Now that Ibaraki’s satisfied though, maybe we ought to put an end to this.

Fufu. That’s right. It was all talk.
There’s no such thing as a Magifender Oni.
There’s no world or law for oni.

If such a thing existed, it wouldn’t be an oni.
If it’s crazy, it’s an oni.
If it rips things apart, it’s an oni.
If it devours people, it’s an oni.
If it ignores the rules, it’s an oni.

Hm? So what about an oni who loses itself, you ask?

Well you know…
They probably writhe and wail.
And they ultimately die, I think?
