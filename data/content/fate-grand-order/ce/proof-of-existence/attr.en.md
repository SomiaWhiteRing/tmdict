I am a contemptible woman.

I was raised as a flower, and my body was refined to be poison.
Though I was given the honor of being the leader of our cult, I betrayed my precious allies.

But…
Oh, but…
I wish, I long, I dream.
And my body aches.
I want to touch someone.
I want to be close to them.
I want to feel their warmth.
I want to be able to do what everyone else can!

…I don’t want to kill.

But I exist to kill.
I kill. I kill. I touch and kill. I caress and kill. I dance and kill.
I hold in my arms and kill. A kiss and I kill.
No matter how strong I want something, I am a weapon that keeps killing. An assassin, a fatal poison.
That will not change no matter what happens.

Someday,
I’m sure,
I will end up killing you too.
