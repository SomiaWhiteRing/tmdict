Gift from Valkyrie.

Sugar snacks that look like amethyst, laid out on a plate shaped like a shield made of divine iron, like that of the warrior maidens.

They’re called sugar snacks, but contain no sugar. They have a sweetness like honey. It appears that they’ve been flavored with magical energy.

Why did they turn out looking like that? It’s likely the girls’ ultimate embodiment of respect and love.
