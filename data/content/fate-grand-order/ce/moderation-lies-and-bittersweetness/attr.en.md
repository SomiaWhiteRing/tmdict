Valentine’s chocolate from Queen of Sheba.

Once upon a time, in a desert nation, a celebrated monk was said to have popularized a golden-colored, aromatic drink…called coffee.
In the past, the drink was a symbol of freedom after one is relieved from heavy taxation. And even in modern times, it is shared amongst friends for lively conversation, or as an alluring drink that leads love to blossom.

Chocolate, which is made with cacao, was also a luxury drink fit for the upper class.
Its superb effects were highly valued, and in Mesoamerica, where cacao originated, the beans itself were used as currency.

With that in mind…
A certain queen who possesses the Eye of the Spirits and has insight to appraise things even in this modern world, stopped by a sundries shop that was brightly lit even in the dark of night, and picked up a somewhat nostalgic snack… 
That’s right…

She saw a business opportunity…
The act of just wandering around the store without any purpose…to kill some time…
Giving a knowing glance towards a confused shop clerk…
For her, this is nothing out of the ordinary.

*Under discussion
[Eha●] “Oh crap…”
[Shta●●] “The shop clerk is totally serious. He’s just completely ignoring her.”
[Shal●●] “What an old-lady move. Let’s ignore what she tried to do… It’s funnier that way.”
