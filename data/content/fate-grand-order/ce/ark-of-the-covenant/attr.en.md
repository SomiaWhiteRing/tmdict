Yes, this Ark was a covenant with God.
It showed what must not be seen, and what must not be done.

Disaster to those who open it.
Despair to those who would reveal its contents.

For this is a sign of Godâ€™s trust in humanity, His belief that we are not foolish enough to open what He has told us not to open.
