Behold. The most beautiful winter constellation, the one and only Orion.
The three shining stars on my waist become the Tri-Star Belt.
Sumiyoshi Sanshin, or you may also know them as Delta, Zeta, and Epsilon.
Well, indeed they are beautiful stars.
But there is something more beautiful than the stars.
What is that you say? Of course it’s your eyes.
They shine with radiance, deeply, lovingly, like the Milky Way itself.
Speaking of which, say beautiful, do you have time later?
What? You do but you can’t? What do you mean there’s a scary-looking girl standing behind me?
Hahahaha, c’mon, you must be jok… (the note ends here)
