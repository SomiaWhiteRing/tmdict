“Whoa!
You dropped into this world, too?”

The next thing you know, you are in a Land of Dreams where any wish can come true.
Led by a pretty, rosy-cheeked fairy who has named himself Tinker Gil, you join a green-colored hero (who resisted the short-shorts until the very end) to go exterminate pirates!

“Duhuhuhuhu… Even if you defeat me, again and again, another me will take my place…”

After an intense battle, a familiar-looking black-bearded man gets captured and put in a compromising position, but laughs defiantly.

Will this great adventure in an imaginary world continue…?
