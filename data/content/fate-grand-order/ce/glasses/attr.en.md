Valentine’s gift from Sigurd.

Ultra special glasses made from Primordial Runes. They obscure anything that the wearer should never see and suppress anything that might be harmful to one’s eye, such as intense light or pollen. The runes help tired eyes recover, and activate when the wearer needs to concentrate, like during study sessions. Truly, these are superb glasses, able to do anything you could wish.

“When these glasses are utilized, your life will soon become rosy.”
…is what Sigurd said… Or maybe not. Probably not.
