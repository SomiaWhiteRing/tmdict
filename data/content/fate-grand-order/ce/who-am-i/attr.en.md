…I am the son of the great King of Knights.
…I am the arrogant Treacherous Knight.
I am both, and both are myself.
But once I put this helmet on, I am neither of them.
I simply become a living being that you can see everywhere, worthlessly struggling for the right to live.
So just like those that draw their last breath, I guess I will perish like they did.
That’s why I want to know, before I leave this world.

…Just who the hell was I?
