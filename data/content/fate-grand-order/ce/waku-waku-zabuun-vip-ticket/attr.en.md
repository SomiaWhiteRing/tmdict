Valentine’s return gift from the young King of Heroes.

A legendary amusement park said to be located in some city.
That is Waku Waku Zabuun.
It’s not boo-yeah.

By the way, it’s cheap to get in, and the equipment is state-of-the-art. It’s an ideal amusement park with a steady stream of new attractions.
However, there is always the possibility of the owner closing down the facility for a private party, so you should check before going.
