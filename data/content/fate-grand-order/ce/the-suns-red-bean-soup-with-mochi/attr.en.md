Valentine’s chocolate from Chacha, who is at the height of her greatness.

Sweet, splendid, and delicious red bean soup, topped with gold dust, and said to have been served during the flower viewing festival at Daigo.

It’s both a wonderfully satisfying sweet dish that Chacha personally served, as well as her own favorite dish.
Eh? You’re wondering why it’s not chocolate, even though it’s for Valentine’s Day? Well, that shouldn’t be a problem, since Chacha wants to eat it with you!
I’m sure you’re starting to get tired of chocolates, so Chacha’s consideration of serving red bean paste is sure to grab Master’s heartstrings!

“What do you think? Good? It’s good, huh? Hehe… Well, that’s…a relief.”
