A pale white noble who sides with Tamamo-no-Mae.

A central character of the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, he possesses many Noble Phantasms and great fighting skill.
He may look unfriendly, and he doesn’t talk much, but he is a good man with a very loyal personality.
And yet for some reason, he sides with the evil Tamamo-no-Mae.

“Call me if there’s a fight.
I may not say anything interesting, but I’ll at least wipe out the enemy.”
