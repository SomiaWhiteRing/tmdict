Chitter-chitter-chitter-chitter-chitter-chitter.
The fluttering of the insect and the sound of the clock’s second hand made a decidedly unpleasant combination.
When I looked at its iridescent carapace, I had the illusion that this bomb was truly alive.

By the way, and this changes the subject, but what’s horrifying about parasites is the way they can lurk inside a defenseless body.

If you agree with me, it’s better to not attract Mephisto’s attention, not even by accident.
One day, you may feel intense pain in your throat, chest, or stomach, along with an itch, which could mean that insect is crawling around inside.

…Compared to that, it be would far more preferable to get blown to bits, right? Heeheeheeheehee!
