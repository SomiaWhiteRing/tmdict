The night is still, as if time has stopped.
The calendar and clock are frozen at 11:59 PM on December 31, and they give no indication of moving forward.
“Oh, were you still awake?”
The girl smiles gently by your side.
The name doesn’t come to you.
The observatory’s lights may be out, but the sky is bright tonight. It’s as if deep blackness veils your eyes.
“It’s quiet, isn’t it? Looks like we’re the only ones left.” The sweet, gentle voice whispers.
Your fingers go slack. Your memories start to grow hazy. Time comes to a standstill.
And you still can’t recall the name.
“Teehee. Do you see this? The stars are all so beautiful.”
Looking up at the sky, it seems that it is now too late.
An enormous abyss. Three red stars. The winter constellation gone mad. And a planet where all life has disappeared.
Could this place be a crater on the surface of the moon?
“Teehee. Hehehe…hehehehe…”
■■ smiles by your side.
You can’t recall the name. Not her name, but your own name.

This is where you will spend your final night.
A cage in the ravine of time and space.
A honeymoon of confinement you can never escape.
