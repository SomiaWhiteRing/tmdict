This shield sings the world’s songs.
A world that witnessed my brief life…
A world that embraced my many battles…
It’s a mirror that reflects all I strove to protect.

Thus, if this Noble Phantasm is activated, be it by man, army, castle, or even god, no attacker will break through.

After all…this shield is the world itself!

Now give it a go, cavalryman of the Black Faction.
I don’t need a shield anymore.
Will this shield win, or will the lance that slays the gods themselves win…
Well, it doesn’t matter to me. Now I can fulfill my agreement with my teacher.

Now get going with it!
