A new chapter begins.
Who will win the Moon Holy Grail?
The Moon Holy Grail War ended, and peace had returned to the Serial Phantasm “SE.RA.PH.”
But an unexpected accident splits the “Regalia,” the symbol of kingship, in two and renders it unable to fully function.
The world of the moon starts to change.
“You” rise once more to become the ruler of the moon.
