Valentine’s Day chocolate from Medb (Saber).

With its fancy box and variously shaped chocolates, it looks like quite the fancy brand of assorted chocolates. The box itself sports the familiar “Medb Brand” sticker.

While it may look store-bought, this is all still handmade by Queen Medb herself. It’s packed full of cacao and magical energy, and one bite of it will guarantee you becoming either a good-looking brave or a slave.

Whether you become a brave or a slave will depend on your resistance, courage, and willpower.
