Valentine’s Day chocolate from Nagao Kagetora.

A chocolate statue of the eight-bladed Bishamonten, the inhuman form of the god Bishamonten who wields numerous treasured weapons to defeat the enemies of Buddhism. It looks terrifyingly strong, and I also hold it in high esteem. Yes, it’s true.

By the way, she has incredible wood carving skills that she acquired when she ran away from home, since the activity became something of a diversion. This chocolate sculpture is also a product of her workmanship. But let’s not talk about the time she ran away.

This truly is the Bishamonten of Echigo! Meow!
