…Yes, that’s right.

When I became a puppet pharaoh at the hands of those in power who looked down on the gods, my throne was filled with the divine light – but more than that, it was stained with blood.

But even though I became the pharaoh, I never forgot the regrets of my brothers who were the young rulers before me, and I did not forgive the shining throne of the pharaoh being toyed with by those commoners.

Those who toyed with the throne of the pharaoh, who is both king and god, must be punished.
Those traitors who laid hands on my dear brothers must be punished.

It seems I’m a girl with a short temper.
I’ll get mad at my ally – you – very quickly.

Perhaps…
It’s because of my actions in life.
Please forgive me.
Ahem. I mean, you shall forgive me!
