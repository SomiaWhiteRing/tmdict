Oh, you’re curious?
About my Noble Phantasm.
About my wine.
Nope! Stop staring at it like you want it.

This is mine, and mine alone.
At first, it wasn’t mine. It belonged to Raikou.
But now it’s all mine.

Still, you know, I’d never thought I’d be willing to die for it…
Not for blood, the moon, or silver; but wine…

I love this wine.
It’s sweet. So sweet.

It tastes so warm, like you’re going to die.
Like you’re going to rot.
Like you’re going to melt away into nothing…

If only there were some blue eyes shining in the moonlight that I could snack on…
I wouldn’t ask for anything else.
