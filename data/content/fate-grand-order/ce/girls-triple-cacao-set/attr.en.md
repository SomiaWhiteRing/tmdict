A set of obligatory chocolates, friendship chocolates, and true feelings chocolate, collected according to information haphazardly gathered by asking friends.

For reasons unknown, the true feelings chocolate, made by Miyu’s mysterious mega skills, is generously covered in gold dust. Taking a bite of it is said to melt the eater’s heart in the night sky, giving them visions of the girl at the end of twinkling lights.

“Um, Miyu, are you sure this is okay? Is this chocolate really safe to eat?”

Other than the fact that it’s extremely high in calories, it has no adverse affects to the body.
