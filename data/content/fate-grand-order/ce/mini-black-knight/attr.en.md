[Information File: HG74M403B]

Its official name is Servant AUX Voloid K6-X4.
A high-functioning robot whose intended purpose is to support Servants during battle and pilot spacecraft.
It’s been X Alter’s companion ever since she could remember. She calls it “Mini Black Knight.”

Its personality programming is rude, and it curses. It seldom even shows itself in front of others.
It looks down on humans, and ignores orders. It is exclusively loyal to X Alter.

A shard of crystalized Alternium embedded in its mainframe allows it to synchronize with X Alter.
As a side note, its body resembles an ancient helmet. This is because it was made from parts recycled from a barbaric mechanical giant that once ground an entire planet into dust.

“I didn’t know that…poor little Voloid. I guess people really can be cruel…”
“――――――"
