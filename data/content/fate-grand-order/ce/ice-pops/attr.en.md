Gift from Scáthach-Skadi.

Classic ice pops, a frozen snack on a stick. Well, that’s what they look like anyway. They’re cold, sweet, and delicious.

“I did remember that they needed to be sweet. I did not use sugar to flavor them though. You see, I’ve flavored them by infusing a bit of magical energy into the ice. Though the ones I’ve had in the past weren’t as refined as these.”

She smiles. As if she’s reminiscing about something far off in the past.

“It was probably the first hundred, maybe two hundred years I was there… I passed these out to my children. It was very fun. Yes… Right, it was truly fun…”

She gently smiles, cherishing what no longer exists…
