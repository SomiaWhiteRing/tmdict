Huh? You’re looking for a kid named Billy?
He’s just a sneaky, third-rate showman.
The fastest gun in the west? Man, don’t tell me you’re spreading that stupid rumor!
He’s just a petty thug.
A bounty hunter with such a beautiful pistol shouldn’t be wasting time on a guy like that!
He’s just a little brat. Are you going to beat the crap out of him?
Oh, fine. I’ll tell you where he is.
It’s okay. Calm down. Calm down. There, there.
We’ll make a trade. Show me that gun.
Wow, I’ve never seen such a shiny gun in the whole wild west! It’s shiny, but it ain’t worth anything else, huh?
What? You want me to tell you now that I’ve seen the gun? Sure, sure.
Lean in close so I can whisper it to you.

Listen, Billy is – he’s right behind you.

I ain’t lying. You spun around, so now I’m standing behind you.
By the way, my gun’s already drawn.
Sure you don’t want to draw that shiny pistol of yours?
