The watchtower’s fire bell rings incessantly.
The blaze spreads far and wide.
As the chief waves the firefighter’s matoi, the banner to show the fire’s location, the gaen and men follow suit.

Firefighting efforts will not cease until all fires are extinguished.
Fires and festivals are both flashy everyday affairs.
