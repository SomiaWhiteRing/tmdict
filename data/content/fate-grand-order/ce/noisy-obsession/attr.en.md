“We’re going to break everything! With our music that is!”

Featuring Hyde (Vocal, Guitar), Arash (Bass), and Astolfo (Keyboard) in a three man band.
They made their major debut in March 2018 during the event Chaldea Boys Collection.
According to some media reports, after the release of their new single, “Stella,” Arash was going to leave!?

But ever since becoming the opening number at their debut concert, Arash has customarily vanished, only to rush back on stage for the 3rd song.
