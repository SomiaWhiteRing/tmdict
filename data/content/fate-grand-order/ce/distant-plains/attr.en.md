…When I open my eyes, I see distant plains.

The comforting feel of the earth, the wind tickling my ears, my beloved bounding about as if she were dancing…

These memories I once had are now all gone.
They weren’t taken from me; I abandoned them.

I’m thankful to whoever it was that brought them back to me.
Human and beast can never reach an understanding; we are fated to kill one another.
You understood that fate, yet never accepted it.
Now, I will tell you: this is where I lived.
