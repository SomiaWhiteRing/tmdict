An elegant flute made from purple jade.
It is one of the instruments that Yang Guifei was versed in playing, along with the pipa.
It is said that the instrument was gifted to her by the Chinese goddess of the moon, Chang’e.

“The two of us trying to play this single flute together…even a playful attempt like that surely will yield a melodic tune.”
