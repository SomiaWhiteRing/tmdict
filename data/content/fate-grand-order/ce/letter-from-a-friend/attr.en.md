“Ah! Gilles! Gilles! My beloved friend!
I imagine you’re now suffering hellish tortures, ones which would demolish my feeble reason!
Your suffering is my suffering.
Your joys are my joys.
And the crime you committed is my crime, as well!
We grow to hate those we love.
As we hate, we are tested.
I consider carefully this discrepancy, this lamentation of the soul, and I think how I wish to save you.
However, I fear there is no escape from this fall from grace.
For there is no remedy that will overcome it.
It is with this in mind that I invite you to visit my workshop. Help me with additional studies and pursuits.
Did you not ask me once before?
Why am I helping you? The answer I’ll put down here for you, the one I love.
While we share a common past, you aren’t like me.
While God have made you suffer and you have ended up where you are as you cursed Him, you do not reject Him.
I have seen the truth of faith there.
While sinking in a sea of evil, I have honest respect for your not having drowned in it.
I will help you till the end of your days.

… Welcome, to the dining hall of nightmares and terror.”
