Her entire world was a canopied bed.

The body that was infested by illness slowly counts down to the end.
The adults standing on the opposite side of the thin sheet who hate, laugh and enjoy one another, are no more than shadow puppets.

The girl gives up on her own life, gives up on intelligent people, and gives up on pursuing the wisdom of others.
