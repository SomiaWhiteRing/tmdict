They say that an evil heart lies beyond the horizon, cursing the world of men.

It is a necessary evil that laughs at the wickedness of mankind.
A safety mechanism to create a tiny bit of peace.
No one remembers the nameless monument.

A normal life, gone forever.
A mind that fell apart.
Hatred burned into everything that surrounded him.
And one last fragment that saw it all.

â€¦The hortensia that loved him, and bloomed on the boundary.
