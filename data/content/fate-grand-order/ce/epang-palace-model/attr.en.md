Our relationship is now one of equals, but do not forget that our true form once ruled over all the world. For those who cling to the idea that humans should retain their human appearance, we acknowledge that this form may seem grotesque. But that is nothing that we regret nor feel ashamed of. That was an inevitable consequence of governing the world for such a long time. We arrived at this form because it was meant to be.
Do not misunderstand; we do not wish to be looked upon with trembling awe. Rather, we wish for you to reminisce, spontaneously at any moment, of our majestic form that once ascended to the skies.
