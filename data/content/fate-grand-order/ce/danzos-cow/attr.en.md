I like cows.

They’re calm, carefree, and they seem to possess a powerful stance like that of someone with great stature.

I do not swallow cows.
According to something-or-other Gundan, Danzo swallowed a cow, but I did not. I do not.

Poor thing…
Sadly, that not a sentiment that I can harbor, but swallowing a cow is an action I consider to be distasteful.
I do not intend to hurt them.
I simply want cows to always be great and dignified.

In my distant memory, yes, I believe I even owned a cow.
I loved it dearly, and I think I may have even put my favorite netsuke charm on it…?
