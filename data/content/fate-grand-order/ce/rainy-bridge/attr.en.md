Valentine’s Day chocolate from Asagami Fujino.

It’s a fine dish that utilizes all the techniques and lessons learned from a home ec class at an all-girls school. Donuts were apparently a staple at dormitory welcome parties. Fujino’s consideration is on full display in her attempt to create something delicious without trying to go too far out of the box. The extra chocolate that’s been added as a finishing touch is what makes this a handmade gift that combines hobby, passion, and endearment.
