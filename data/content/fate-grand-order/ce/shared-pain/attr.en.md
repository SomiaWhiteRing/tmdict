Whew, curse access point, transfer of ownership complete!
Now your pain is mine!♪

Though it’s a simple spell, it’s surprisingly annoying…
It tickles, and makes something shiver in the depths of my body.
Heey, you’re making that face again.
…Hmm, I see. Your chest hurts a little, huh?
Are you feeling guilt?
…Huh? Don’t start thinking I like pain.
This isn’t some kind of masochism, it’s strategy!
When I was connected with Illya, it wasn’t all bad.
The pain sharpened my heart, and there were things I was only able to survive because of that.
Rin put this scribble on me, and I left it on for longer than I’d originally intended, but it was more useful than I thought.

…And you know what else?
Sometimes you space out and do something dangerous, blame yourself, or do something really reckless…
For those times, I can be together with you.
Even if it’s just a little, you’ll think of me.
If you think about that, the pain doesn’t matter at all.
So don’t hold back and give it all to me, okay Master? ♪
