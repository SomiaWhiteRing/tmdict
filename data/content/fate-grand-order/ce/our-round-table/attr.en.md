A heartfelt, poetic, and intellectual comedy.

It’s a story of an eleven-sibling family called the Round Table. By chance, this big family adopts the Little Lion King. This small-town adventure manga centers on the Little Lion King, who already carries herself like royalty, while the Round Table brothers don’t really do much other than stand around being handsome.

Though small in scale, plenty of world-altering events occur in the story. Most of them are Merlin’s fault.
