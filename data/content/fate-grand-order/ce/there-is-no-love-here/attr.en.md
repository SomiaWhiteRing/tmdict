Rome is everything.
When our great founder created this empire, it was unmistakably one large step for humankind. We have plenty of wealth and prosperity here. It is only fitting that Rome be a gleaming beacon of leadership.

Yet at the same time…
There are things gathering in Rome that call out to horrifying, terrifying, negative thoughts and evil maxims.

Therefore, what is the true reason for my own descent into madness? Did I wish to become violent? Did I seek out fresh blood and atrocities?
No. I did not.

The moon goddess saved me from insanity. The empire’s squirming evil personal standards had not been eliminated from the dark side of town. A whirlpool of schemes threatened to draw me in, but the moon goddess could not stand to see me like that, so she turned me around.

…And so, I am crazed. I am furious. I howl at, pierce, shatter everything. Full of desire but no love, I devour and consume.

Oh, Nero…
Beloved child of my younger sister, Agrippina, and the spitting image of her.
I don’t care if it is but modest. I want you alone to be happy. Be awash in light and love. I will take away the darkness and evil, the lunacy and rage.
Therefore, may your path be filled with blessed roses.
