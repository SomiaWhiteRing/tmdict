Valentineâ€™s Day chocolate from Ryougi Shiki (Assassin).

A normal, heart-shaped chocolate. Handmade.
Red and white decorations adorn it. How auspicious.
But something must have happened while she was making it, because it looks like someone stabbed it right through the heart.

Just like a cat destroys your pillows when it gets agitated, when you have a dumb smile on your face, a chocolate meets an unfortunate fate.
