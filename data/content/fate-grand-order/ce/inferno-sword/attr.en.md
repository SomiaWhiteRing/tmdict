In a darkened room, a jet-black knife…
Nay, a charred knife stabbed into a desk.

The slander and contempt that society directed at Salieri during his lifetime was like a wildfire raging in his heart, and a blade stabbing through it.
Avenger Salieri wields that very thing as his weapon.
At first glance, it looks like a sword, but in essence…it is as you see.

It is a raging wildfire contained in a blade.
