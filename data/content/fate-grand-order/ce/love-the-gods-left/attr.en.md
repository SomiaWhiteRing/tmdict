You want to know about this crown?
Well, you see…

The old Norse gods left it to me, you know, before they were destroyed by the flaming sword. This happened long before our Scandinavian world met with destruction.

From the Nine Worlds that formed the Norse…
A single drop of brilliance was collected from each of the realms’ most precious objects. With all nine of these, the gods wove a crown for their bride.

Surprisingly, this crown doesn’t possess any magical energy at all.
It’s just an ordinary crown…

But isn’t it beautiful?
I think so too, yes.
