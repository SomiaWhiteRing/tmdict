Aaaahhhhh…!
I’m soooooo tiiiiirrrreeedd!

Mordred is closed for maintenance right now.
Even for you, Master. If you want something, come see me later.
Huh? You just want to be with me?
Hmm, well… yeah. If that’s it… well, I guess, me too?
Uh, sure? You’re not bothering me, anyway?
Alright, let’s take a nap on the beach!
No, because you’ll get a nasty tan?
You’re so dumb, Master.
That’s why we’ve got suntan lotion!
…So, here’s the deal.
Well, I guess I can trust you.
Come on, rub lotion on me.
Just so we’re clear, touch me anywhere weird and I’ll punch you.
Got it? No touching! You’d better not, okay!?

…HYAAAAAAAUUUUU!?
