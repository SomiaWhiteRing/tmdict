Valentine’s chocolate from Altera Santa.

It has always been a dream of yours to eat a whole cake on your own.
And this cake is chock full of Altera Santa’s unforgettable memories from her Christmas travels.

“Ho ho ho. I’d like a bite too, but then all the frosting would get on my mustache.
My Fluffy Master, eat to your heart and stomach’s content! That is the best gift I can give you.”
