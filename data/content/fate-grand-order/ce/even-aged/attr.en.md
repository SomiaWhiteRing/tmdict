Aging saps my strength, and the ferocity I was born with has calmed. Peaceful days dull my skills, yet to my surprise and wonder there is a part of me that has accepted this.

Thoughâ€¦and let me be very clear of this:
My fist still knows no defeat.
That being so, the fist that they learn from me must also be the strongest. And one day, there will be a disciple who will surpass me. The day where I will be awash in resentment and pride is inevitable.

Or perhaps not.
I may yet remain undefeated until my end.
