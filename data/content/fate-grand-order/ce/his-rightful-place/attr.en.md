Once a great king went on an expedition to the farthest lands.

Raise the flags, so his name shall be known throughout the world.
Praise his name, so his authority shall leave a mark on this world.
And that’s why we shall continue to march forward.

The expedition will not end.
Glory lies beyond the horizon. It’s worth the challenge because it’s unreachable. Until the eventual end of time. Praise and show to the world the path of conquest.
All to be with our great king.
