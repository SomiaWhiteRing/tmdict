Fold it here, tug this over there…
See? Isn’t it splendid?
A princess must be good with her hands.
Whenever I fold origami, people are sure to praise me and say things like: “Oh! What a wonderfully genteel, artistic princess!”

So I tried folding a little Master to practice.
Oh and by the way, I put a curse on it, so any damage done to it will harm you too.
So take good care of it, okay? Okay!?

…What’s with that look!?
Do you have a problem with people folding origami of their loved ones!?
