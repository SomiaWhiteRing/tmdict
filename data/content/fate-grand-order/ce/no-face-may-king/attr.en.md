Nothing more than a scoundrel. No different than a bandit.
Not something you want your name associated with.
A hood and mud suit you well.

Humans do well when they focus on hiding themselves.
No one will hate them, and no one will target them.
If no one depends on them, no one will love them, either.

Whoever thinks that living like that would be easier, they stop being human.
Do you think you’ve managed to acquire a lot of things?
Unfortunate for you, that’s just an illusion.
A man without a face, also has no eyes to see.
He cannot obtain anything.
