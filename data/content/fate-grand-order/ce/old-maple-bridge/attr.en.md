Valentine’s return gift from Yagyu Tajima-no-kami.

An old maple tree and its autumn foliage…a most dazzling sight.

Houtokuji is a temple that still exists today in Nara City’s Yagyushimochou.
It is the Yagyu family temple, built by the monk Takuan, who was commissioned by Yagyu Tajima-no-kami.

The hill that leads up to the temple is called Reigenzaka, and the bridge at the foot of the hill is called the Momiji (Old Maple) Bridge.
These sights and others throughout the area have been dubbed the “Ten Sights of Yagyu,” which were selected by Takuan.

(There is also a theory that Takuan never set foot at Yagyu Estate in his life.)
