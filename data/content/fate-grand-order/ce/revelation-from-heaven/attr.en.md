She heard the voice of the Lord.
The voice was serene yet full of sorrow, and it told her to save the people.
The maiden, dreaming of beautiful tomorrows, chose to stand up and fight.
For her village, for her nation, and for the Lord.

Goodbye, Jeanne dâ€™Arc of Domremy.
The happiness she once dreamed of, still hangs high over the skies of your home.
