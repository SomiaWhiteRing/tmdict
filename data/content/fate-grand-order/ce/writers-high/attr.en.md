“A new issue? I don’t believe it, but looks like we managed to make it in time! I don’t know how many we made, but go ahead and take whatever catches your eye! Price? We can’t possibly put a price on them. Why don’t you use that head of yours and a bit of common sense as a reader to decide!? But that aside, we’ll charge at least 100 BB Bucks to cover the printing cost.”
