A return gift from Bartholomew.

An item that made Master and other Servants say things like:
“This is definitely creepy.”
“This is seriously off-putting.”
“What was he thinking?”

Put this on and anybody can be a master of mekakure. Or rather, maybe anybody can become a Master when they put it on?

An intense battle over the wigs would surely ensue the moment a handful of Servants realized this truth, but nobody seems to have figured it out…yet.
