Valentine’s Day chocolate from the Great Stone Statue God.

A chocolate-flavored premium cake roll.
Looks really sweet. And it comes with chai!
“And that’s exactly why, Jinako” was the comment later made by the white-haired Lancer.

It’s a product that’s typically not available in Chaldea, but the Great Stone Statue God used her Authority to get her hands on one.
