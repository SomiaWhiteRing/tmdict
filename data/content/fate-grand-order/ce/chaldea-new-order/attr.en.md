Valentine’s Day chocolate from the young Da Vinci.

The original Leonardo da Vinci crafted an extremely gorgeous chocolate, but since the young Da Vinci is clumsy with her hands, she wasn’t able to make something as artistically grandiose. However, the amount of thought and heart she put into hers is a match to her original self. The chocolate Shadow Border on top of the cake is actually a perfectly preserved food. Should you decide not to eat it, it will last (as a model) and will remain a cherished memory forever.
