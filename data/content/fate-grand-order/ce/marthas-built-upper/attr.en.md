The fact that we’ve been summoned as Servants means that we all strive to become the strongest!

At the tropical beach, a bare-knuckle fighting tournament is set to begin!

Though Martha had no intention of participating, she had no choice but to do so in order to reclaim her stolen Holy Knuckles.

“Bring it on! I’ll have every single one of you repent!”

Ushiwaka the jumping swallow, the Mutou-dori Yagyu, and king fist Beowulf… After defeating many powerful opponents, her final adversary, Sasaki Kojirou of Ganryu, appears before her!

“Gentleness is key to counter torrents, I see.”

With all her moves blocked or countered, Martha was cornered. Then, as her last-ditch effort, she unleashes a secret move that she developed during her youth that she swore never to use…!

Unfortunately, that was all they had time to do, so the book simply ends there…
