“The wonderful recipes from the cafeteria in my beloved new Chaldea were stolen, and we observed that a certain diner has been brazenly serving those very dishes. Since we had some time on our hands, we declared this incident a Micro-Singularity, and a new Rayshift technique fittingly appropriate for my new Chaldea has been boldly executed!”

　　　Excerpt from:
Chapter 13 of the Musik Accounts/The Phoenix Flaps 13 Times

(But that’s strange. We’ve been riding for two days straight…and the diner we’re looking for is called Restaurant to Another World: ChiefRed…?)
…Um, sir? Would you believe it if I told you we’re not on Earth?”
“Eh? …Haha, such nonsense.
But now that you mention it, our communication issue still hasn’t been resolved, I think I saw something that looked like a tyrannosaurus, and I can only assume that this place has two suns… Must be my imagination. Don’t you agree, Mister Fish and Chips!?”
