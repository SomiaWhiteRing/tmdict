Valentine’s return gift from Tristan.

While drunk, Tristan enthusiastically participated in a photo shoot. This CD jacket of Tristan surfaced the next day.
After sobering up, Tristan tried his best to collect all copies of the photo, but the moment the CD fell into Mordred’s hands, it was all over for Tristan…!

But the photo he was most embarrassed by was not approved, so he is at least relieved by that.
