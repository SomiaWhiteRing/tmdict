The laurel wreath is the proof of the Emperor.
I am the number one citizen of Rome as well as the Rose Emperor, and those who accept me shall receive even greater blessings!
Umu, accept me with all your heart!

Umu? Something is inscribed on my ring?
Well, of course!

“To have and to hold,
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health,
until death do us part,
swear that you will care for me for eternity!”
