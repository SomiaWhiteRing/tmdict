Challenging all armies, defying all things, exterminating all people.
Unswayed by other people, he has no need for lovers, comrades, children, or even kings.
Ever lonely, ever mighty, ever victorious.

Killing. Killing. He keeps on killing.
At the end of his path is a hill of corpses.
Sing of his might, praise his might, and make known his might.
Even if no one acknowledges it, I will acknowledge it.

His name is CÃº Chulainn, the mightiest warrior of Ulster.
