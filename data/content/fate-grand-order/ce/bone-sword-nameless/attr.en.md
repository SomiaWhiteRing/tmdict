…You’ve never seen something like this before?
Hah. Of course not! There’s no way a child of man could tell what meaning and value my blade has!

Behold!
This is the Great Bone Blade, that only an oni can possess!
It’s made from hatred and curses, and is far more powerful than a blade of iron!

Forged in flames as hot as the fires of hell, that no steel could withstand, my oni bone is the hardest substance on Earth! It took hundreds of days to forge, and shakes the moonlit night with its great and strange power!

…Heheh. Go ahead. I shall allow it.
Tremble in terror as much as you like!
