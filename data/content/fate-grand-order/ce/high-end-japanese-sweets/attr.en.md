Valentine’s Day chocolates from Ryougi Shiki (Saber).

The circumstances are unclear, but as she’s manifested to this world, she headed over to a famous department store and purchased these expensive Japanese sweets after carefully trying each of them.

“I never dreamed I would be able to experience something like this.”

Those who witnessed her shop saw a secretly smiling, exceptional beauty like a delicate flower blooming in the night.
