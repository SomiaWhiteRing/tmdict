A gift from Diarmuid (Saber).

A nice, shiny red fruit. It sparkles.

This beautifully paints the great land. According to the immram, it’s was found when the warrior Bran, whose fate crosses paths with Diarmuid’s adoptive father, Manannán, landed in one of the Otherworlds in Celtic Mythology.

It looks very much like an apple. It tastes very much like an apple.
