You have formed a strong bond with me. Wonderful.
And so I trust you. Implicitly. I shall fight beside you with all the strength that I possess.

Yet…
Trust sometimes becomes a burden.
Trust banishes all suspicion, making it unnecessary, unwelcome, and that can lead to pain.

Distrust is a good thing.
Be wary of those who are enraged over your distrust.
Those are the people who have the most to hide, with secrets they hope others will never discover.
That is why you must continue to be watchful. Vigilant.
No matter how versed an individual is in deception, the act itself is unnatural. That unnatural behavior will always reveal itself eventually.

Ah, but I digress…
Come now. I swear that this cup contains no poison…

…Do you believe my words?
