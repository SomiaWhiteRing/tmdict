One of the Noble Phantasms that Gareth possesses.
A mysterious ring bestowed to her in life by Lady Lyonesse.
It is a ring that can change colors and even the wearer’s appearance.
It is said that this ring proved extremely useful during the many jousting matches she took part in as she concealed her identity.

Such Mystics are certainly marvelous, but they are also something to be feared.
I have many things to be grateful for thanks to this ring, but I also had a number of problems thanks to this it as well.
The biggest trouble it ever got me into was when…let’s see…
Oh! Definitely when my identity was concealed using the ring, I had to go up against my big brother Gawain one-on-one!

Two hours…
Our battle lasted for a whole two hours.

I was brought to my absolute limit, both physically and mentally.
I was only able to stay standing because of my pride as a knight.
But my big brother…
And the fact that it was daytime…urgh…
He was very…
He was oh-so-enthusiastic the whole time…
Not tired at all!
