A cat thinks, therefore a cat is.

What is a meal?
Is it one to make themselves? Or to be made by others?
To give to oneself? Or to be given to others?
No cat has reached this truth yet.
Only the one who mastered the culinary arts gets to wear this pink robe.
The Cat Mage Merlin says, “Whoever wears this apron will make an ideal wife, and will also be able to govern Chaldea.”

…I thought about a story. What do you think?
