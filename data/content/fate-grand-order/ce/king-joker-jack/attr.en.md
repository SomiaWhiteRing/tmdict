A vacation isn’t just about frolicking under the summer sun.
An intellectual battle under the clear sky with a cocktail in hand is also delightful.

“Ah, what a coincidence meeting you here, Master.
How about a quick round?
Lord Vlad may be evil at heart, but he plays fair.
Sir William only pursues a grand comeback.
And yours truly strives for an enjoyable match.
Why, there’s nothing to fear!
After all, this old man never lies!”
