A sweet crystalization that anyone could melt in a single bite, even if they weren’t an incarnation of destruction.

The human sense of beauty is something I have yet to fully understand…
But I do know that the exchange of feelings is at the heart of beauty.

…A memory from a faraway land that shouldn’t have been retained.
A miracle that occurred in a far-off phenomenon.
The fleeting vision of my journey across a vast field shines ever within my mind.
