“What? What’s the story with these sunglasses?
No big story here. These are just ordinary sunglasses.
But, from all the sunglasses I’ve seen, these gotta be the most GOLDEN sunglasses!
I mean, its got UV protections!
To be honest, it’s easier to go full spark on the enemies with these on. Or else, it’s a little bit too bright, y’know?”
(Sakata Kintoki, at Chaldea)
