Valentine’s chocolate from Meltryllis.

A dazzling chocolate that sparkles like a crystal.
It was created by breaking apart a solid chocolate rock mass.
Apparently, Meltryllis was spotted in the kitchen, kicking the chocolate rock with her heels excitedly, shouting, “Here I go…here I go!” in the middle of the night.

It’s cold when you eat it, and if you’re not careful, you might cut your tongue.
Melt claims that the nectar inside the chocolate is her virus that melts one’s body and soul…but could that be true…?
