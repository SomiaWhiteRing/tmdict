I don’t need this anymore, so you can have it. It wasn’t a particularly interesting book to begin with. I already skimmed through it multiple times, and I even tried reading it literally sideways and upside-down. But there’s still no way for me to understand human sensibility. Telling me to enjoy it is a tall order in itself.

It did come in handy though, especially as here in Chaldea, no one was ever willing to bother somebody who was trying to read. And for that alone, this place was definitely better than many others I could have spent my time in.

That’s right. This book was a shield with which I could deceive others. That’s why I don’t need this anymore. After all, there’s no need for me to lie about my origins anymore, now is there?
