Valentine’s Day chocolate from Sima Yi (Reines).

Though the packaging is from a confectionary Reines frequents, it’s not entirely clear how she acquired what is within. According to Reines, she extracted and refined a portion of the Supreme Mystic Code, Volumen Hydrargyrum, to make it into chocolate, whether she’s serious is very much open to debate.

Now then.
Do you have the courage to try this or not?
