Valentine’s return gift from Cú Chulainn (Prototype).

The “hastily made lance” that he normally uses in combat.
During a certain Holy Grail War that was once fought in another land, he used this weapon instead of his true Noble Phantasm, which was sealed away as a trump card.
He carries a few of these around.

…Did he gift this because he had spares?
Nay. He’s gifting it to you because it’s a special item.
