Valentine’s Day chocolate from Okita Souji (Alter).
A dish of the endless realm combining two delicious things that Miss Majin has prepared. It appears she created the dish after spending her entire allowance earned from her daily chores. For some reason, Rengokuken was shivering all the way through the cooking process. The horror…

Aside from its appearance, it’s quite delicious. Actually, it has a similar flavor to miso dengaku and it’s surprisingly good. Well done, Miss Majin.

A fragment of memory that could never be lost, despite her long journey. May it yet remain even under this sky.

“But honestly, I didn’t think beef tendon would work. No, it really doesn’t.”
