The jaguar’s eyes shine in the darkness.

The jaguar is death.
The jaguar is fangs.
The jaguar is claws.
The jaguar is sudden death, terror, and unavoidable pain.
The jaguar is the jungle itself.

Yet sometimes, the jaguar can also bring blessings.
As the symbol of nature itself, that often takes away life, and sometimes nurtures it, it’s said that the jaguar gave humanity the first fire.

Gave?

According to the traditions of the Ge Indians, humanity stole it.
Humanity stole great wisdom and power from nature, which they were supposed to fear.
