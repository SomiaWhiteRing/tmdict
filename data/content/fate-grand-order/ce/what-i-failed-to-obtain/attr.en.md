I wanted power.
I wanted proof of strength.
I wanted honor.
I wanted a warrior’s pride.
I wanted it all, and I ended up hurting others and doing many disgraceful things.
…Because of that, I wasn’t able to obtain the chakram. Funny, since it was a weapon that I could easily get a hold of just by stretching my arms out during my past life.

I want power.
I want power to protect you.
Protect, protect, and keep on protecting…and if I ever die in battle, I probably won’t regret it.

But then the moment I made that vow, surprisingly, this weapon of mine suddenly felt right within my grasp.
My pride is infused into this weapon.
And what I should protect is now on my back.
