There’s a saying that if you run after two hares, you will catch neither.
People from the olden days sure meowed a bunch of cle-fur things.
And yep, life is indeed full of failures like that.

However!
If you’re going to call yourself a goddess, the correct thing to do is to claim BOTH fames!
Be the best at martial arts! Be smart! Be SEXY!
THAT’S the true eye of the tiger!

By the way, do you think this lady with the scales is more muscular than me-ow!?
