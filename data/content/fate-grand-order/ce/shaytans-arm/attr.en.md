“I will become this era’s Old Man, no matter what.
For that very purpose, I will not hesitate to sacrifice my body.
At the end, if I am without talent or skill, then I will gladly feed my boring arm to the demon.”

And so, the man sacrificed his right arm to the demon.
The demon, tricked by the man, entrusted his right arm to him.
The man finally became the best of the assassins.
Behold, the terrifying cursed arm.
The arm that can trick reality and rip the heart out of any mirror image.
It was a fitting demise, for a man who threw way his humanity, and his identity.
