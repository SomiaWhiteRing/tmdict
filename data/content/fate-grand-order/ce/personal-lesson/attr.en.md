A Magecraft seminar instructed by the Director of Chaldea herself.
She is strict both in the classroom and in field practice, but at the same time, she is detailed and patient.
She will take her time to teach each student no matter how bad they might be.

However, one should be mindful about tardiness.
She will bring down her wrath upon any student who dares to be late.
