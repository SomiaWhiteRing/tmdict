Namu Tenjin. Tenman Daijizai.
Two opposites, two trancedental existences. A conclusion is sought at the end of inclusion.

Divine the finite from an infinite set of possibilities.
The limits constrict and a single conclusion is reached.
The correct conclusion, with no room for any other option.
The celestial zero is the answer to my blade and heart.

In emptiness lies virtue, and no evil.
Wisdom exists, principle exists, the way exists. The spirit is to be empty.

What I master is not the techniques of the blade.
The path of the sword is the greater enlightenment, and it is my offering to this empty temple.
