Valentine’s return gift from Sherlock Holmes.

This is not my origin story, but one could say that everything began here.


My apologies, I digress.
This is the very first piece of work within a series that chronicles my marvelous activities.

This is the very first edition.
Be careful when reading it. It is fragile, so its pages may tear.

Now, could this be a record written by Dr. John H. Watson, or is it merely creative work from the mind of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
Perhaps it’s neither.
I’ll leave that to you to determine.

As far as its contents…
Not to say that the stories are full and accurate retellings of the cases I have worked, but the incidents contained therein may have occurred. Of course, it is worth noting that any truths unsuitable for publication were removed. I saw to that personally.

Hm?

Oh you heard me right.
The uncensored manuscript is likely to exist somewhere out there!
