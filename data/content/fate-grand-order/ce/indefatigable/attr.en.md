She kept on resisting, kept on fighting.
On the battlefield.
In England, as well.
Rather than resting on her laurels for the praise for her exploits in Crimea, she earnestly confronted the world.

This is a world where lives are easily lost, when no one offers a helping hand, when no one says or does anything.
Unsanitary conditions, apathy, ignorance, and various diseasesâ€¦
The world was a capsule that held all her enemies.

She kept on resisting, kept on fighting.
That battle continues even today.
At this very moment, nurses everywhere keep up the fight, carrying on her will and the vow she made.
