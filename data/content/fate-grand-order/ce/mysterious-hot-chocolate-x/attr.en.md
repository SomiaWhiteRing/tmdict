Valentine’s chocolate from Mysterious Heroine X (Alter).

I usually prefer green tea.
But sometimes I want to drink cocoa or coffee.
So at times like this, I go to Spacebucks. They’re a Servant Universe-wide chain that even has a branch on Planet Totooine in the Outer Rim.
This is what I always order, with lashings of mysterious dark matter syrup♪
