A gift (?) from Salieri.

A conductor’s baton that looks to have been scorched in an inferno. It is such a deep black that it seems to have been formed from darkness itself. In fact, it is a replica of the conductor’s wand he used during his lifetime…probably. Based on its shape and style, it seems to at least be the right age.
