This is the end of my dream. The wreckage of a dream.
I wanted to be king. I wanted to be known as a great king.
That’s why I seduced a woman that I didn’t even care for, whispered sweet nothings to her, and did some things I’m not proud of.
Well, “some” might be putting it lightly.

…And then I cut ties with that witch. Even though I tried to do the right thing, I went about trying to justify it the wrong way.
And apparently, this is supposed to be my punishment. Dammit! Can I get another chance? Do I get a second chance?
Give me another chance! Next time, I’ll treat her better… I’ll do it all better. Just you wait and see. I’ll show you!!!
…Dammit…
