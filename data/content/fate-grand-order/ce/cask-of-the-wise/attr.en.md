I met a wise man after my first battle.
He preferred the lifestyle of a dog, and mocked philosophy.
He was like that of a mad Socrates.
Indeed, he looked like a dog lying under the sun.

I said to him, “If you have a wish, it shall be granted.”
The wise man shrugged his shoulder and said,

“Move, you are blocking my sun.”

…I see, now that’s interesting.
Living a life like that doesn’t sound so bad, but it would be a bit difficult for me.
