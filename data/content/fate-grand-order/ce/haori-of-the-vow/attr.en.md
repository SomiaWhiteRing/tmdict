―――The pale blue haori that will never be worn again.

A haori that was said to be worn by the best group of warriors of the Bakumatsu, the Shinsengumi.

Comrades who dashed through the ages together. Some fell from battle, some succumbed to disease, while some were undone by despair. There is nobody left who can stand next to him.

He was truly the man who started it all, and the last of the Shinsengumi.
His vow now far in the distance, but his “makoto”―his sincerity―remains.
