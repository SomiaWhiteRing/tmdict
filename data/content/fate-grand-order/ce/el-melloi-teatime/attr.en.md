Allow me to raise something of a dreary subject. Now, now, there’s no need to brace yourself quite so much.

Have I ever mentioned that I was almost poisoned as a young child? It was concealed in a platter of shiny sweets and aromatic tea. As it happened, I gobbled them all up because I was enthralled by the spread. I was on the brink of death for a whole week.

Since then, I have a habit of carrying preserved foods, and I procure my own sweets. Anyway, what do you think of today’s teatime?

…Hm? Poison doesn’t affect you?
Come on, how could you be so insensitive? Couldn’t you at least feign fear in consideration of your mentor!?

Oh, well.
I have plenty of time today.
In exchange for some special sweets and tea, tell me your story, my pupil.
