Valentine’s Day chocolate from Quetzalcoatl (Samba/Santa).

It’s shaped very much like the flat bell that sits at the edge of the ringside table. For some reason, it will make a loud, ringing sound when struck with a mallet. Wait… This is a gong!

Ring it once, and experienced warriors will immediately get into full battle mode, while hitting it repeatedly lets the fighting warriors know that the fight’s been called.

But the moment its golden wrapper is peeled away, a truly sweet chocolate is uncovered. Eating it will give you tons of energy (power).

Whether you can’t help but dance to the rhythm of the samba, or you straddle the ropes to enter the ring, the kindhearted goddess will join you with a smile.
