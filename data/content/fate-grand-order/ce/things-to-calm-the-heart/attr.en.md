Don’t lose your heart.
Don’t forget to care, protect, and love.

People would easily fall into sinful pleasures.
Do not hurt, mock, or degrade others.
Because that is only a manifestation of weakness.
Everyday, I stand in front of the mirror and caution myself.
Be righteous.
Even if the world is filled with so many evils.
