A fantasy story of ancient India blazing in the tropical sunshine. This epic seems unable to be contained within the pages of a doujin, where the incredible spectacle is sure to keep you at the edge of your seats. The tale focuses on two warriors whose fate made them walk different paths, but are eventually revealed to be related to each other.

Heretofore unheard-of production methods stemming from an avant-garde thought process and bizarre gimmicks create a feast for the reader’s eyes. The only thing those who read this work can find it in themselves to say is “Holy moly, India’s amazing!” Plus, the production values of the song-and-dance declaration of love are incredible.

But since this is just a fantasy story, it’s important to keep in mind that it isn’t at all historically accurate.
