A new frontier presents a multitude of possibilities to a sentient being.
This adventure is just one of them.
It is a story of humans who traveled to distant space, 1,500 light-years away.

Under the golden city that spreads infinitely, the king himself walks, faces challenges and grows excited at the future that runs through time. The king smiles.
The smile is directed to the idiotic but proud challenger with whom he once traveled and formed a contract in the sea of the moon.
