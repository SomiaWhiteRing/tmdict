I never imagined this ring would become my Noble Phantasm…

Oh, yes. It’s normally not my Noble Phantasm. It belonged to Princess Angelica, who hailed from the land of Cathay, and it’s a wonderful piece that is said to be able to nullify all kinds of magecraft. Thanks to this ring, I was able to emerge victorious from my battle against the evil mage Atlante.

Princess Angelica was very beautiful. My older brother Rinaldo, and even the paladin Roland both were enthralled by her at one point… And if two out of the Twelve Paladins fell in love with her, then wow, she must’ve been super attractive!

My Princess, where are you and what are you doing now…?
…
…
Oh, that’s right. We aren’t in the era when I was alive anymore.
I was just reminiscing. Sorry. But I still do hope we can see each other again one day.

Come again? If I’ve kept such an important ring this whole time, the Princess might be angry when we reunite? Ahhh! Y-y-you’re right! What should I do!? I-I-I can’t believe I ended up doing the sort of thing ’Stolfo does!
