Do you want to know what the Land of Shadows is like?
Just as the name implies, it’s a place where shadows consume everything.
A world of darkness and death without a single ray of light.
Isn’t it ironic that Cú Chulainn came here?
Isn’t he a child of the sun?

…There are seven walls in the Land of Shadows.
But these walls are not literal, they are symbols of the absolute rule in this land. Which is,

“The dead cannot come back to life.”

People from the Land of Shadows cannot cross the wall to return to Earth.
At least, that should’ve been the case. Master, I am looking forward to the day where you save the world and send me back to where I belong.
