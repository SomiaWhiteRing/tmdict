A nameless bowman in a crimson coat who sides with Nero.

He is a nameless Heroic Spirit with no True Name, but he can adapt his fighting style to whatever method he wants, and despite being an Archer he can use twin blades in close-quarters combat.
He may look like a realist who highly values logic, but he can actually be very emotionally attached. Nero doesn’t really remember when he joined her side, but this mysterious stranger supports the new king from the shadows.

“I won’t ask questions about your situation.
My own circumstances are pretty complicated.”
