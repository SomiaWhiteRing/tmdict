You say a Servant doesn’t dream?

Don’t be silly.
There’s nothing strange about dreaming while one sleeps, and last night, I was no exception.
Servants do not require sleep, you say?
Honestly, I don’t really have time for your jokes right now…

…
Now that you mention it…
I do not remember the last time I rested in a bed…
No, it must be my imagination.

Ah yes. We were talking about dreams.

It has been a long time since I dreamed.
It could have been something that happened long ago, or it could have happened just yesterday.
Strange, but I feel at peace right now.
I suppose dreams are not such a bad thing now and then.

Come again?
You’re asking what happened to my umbrella-shaped machine gun and red outfit?

What are you talking about?
Commander, you of all people should know that I always wear my army uniform during battle.
Unbelievable.
Oh…you too?

Did you also have an enjoyable dream?
