Even after taking the throne and all the familicide, it wasn’t enough blood for the cursed axe.

Made from a demonic beast and forged by a witch.

The king is aware of the curse, yet if the axe will help him demonstrate his authority as a king, then he has no regrets.

Let the feast of blood begin.
