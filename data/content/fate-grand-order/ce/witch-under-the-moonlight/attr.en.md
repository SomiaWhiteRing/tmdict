The night of the full moon belongs to the girls who fly through the skies.

When this self-proclaimed genius witch and her white familiar visit you, will they bring bad luck, or good?

Everything is in the hands of this voluptuous witch.

*In the Middle Ages, “witch” was a general term used for anyone who practiced magecraft, regardless of gender.
