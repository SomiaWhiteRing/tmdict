The summer battle is over.
The heated and passionate Water Blitz tournament, held on the Island of Hawaii and fought amongst the summer soldiers, is fading away like the red sunset on Waikiki beach.

“What is with the brilliance of this Penguin Cup? It’s like the midsummer sun!”

The girl who became the world champion smiles brightly as she dons the cape she received upon winning.
Next year’s summer is going to be hot, too.
You squint at the brilliance of the king’s smile, while your mind dreams of next year’s summer.

As for what exactly happened…
Just imagine hosting a festival at a resort, all the while fighting off giant monsters from the sea and wiping out people camping for an event.
Those visions comes to mind and fade away.
Haha… No way that’s what happened.

“That’s probably a sign of sunstroke. Why don’t we rest in the shade, Master?”
