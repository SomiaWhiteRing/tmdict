Chocolates from Kiyohime (Lancer).

Sigh. I cannot tell a lie, nor would I want to.
Thus, I shall confess honestly that I am using an elixir of love.
I know Master would not want to drink it, but I must do what I must do.
I will sneak in during the night and pry open Masterâ€™s mouth to slowly feed them my chocolates. I can do this!

My plan is perfect, Master!
Just you wait, okay!?

As a footnote, drinking the provided antidote made all of her planning go up in smoke. How sad.
