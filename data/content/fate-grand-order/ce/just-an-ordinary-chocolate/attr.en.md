Chocolate from Anne Bonny & Mary Read (Archer).

An ordinary-looking chocolate that contains a key inside.
It seems like this is a key to their room.

You could use this key to get into their room at night, or you could…not do that.

Perhaps they might be waiting so you could help them clean their room…
