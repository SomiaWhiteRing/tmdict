“…Welcome.
Make yourself comfortable.”

There is a small bar located in a discreet corner of a city building. The quiet shop seems out of place in such a dark city, but it has three rules that must always be followed:

1. Never agree to a get-rich-quick scheme with a man who calls himself “Admiral.”
2. Never test your strength against a certain old man.
3. Never mention a man known for his exceptional sprinting speed in front of the bar’s owner.
