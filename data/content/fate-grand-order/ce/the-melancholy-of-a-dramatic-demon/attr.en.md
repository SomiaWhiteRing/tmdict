There’s no sense debating how well it turned out. The point is, everyone brainstormed, agonized over it, and put all their efforts in to making this this doujin for their club, Gespenst Ketzer.

It’s a story about a demon who possesses immeasurable power and a girl, but the plotting is slow and kind of confusing. Readers were also able to detect the writer’s embarrassment through some of the characters’ lines. And even the action scenes that should’ve been included are omitted, possibly due to lack of time.

That may have been so, but none of it really matters. The work itself fairly exudes an aura of pride and joy. It’s a very natural response anyone might have after creating their own story. It all began here.
