Valentine’s return gift from Napoleon.

Numerous canned foods stuffed to the brim. Each can proudly bears the seal of Emperor Napoleon. They’re Napoleon-brand canned foods.

“Ooh la la! These are perfect vittles for the Grande Armée! Even the Winter General is no match for us with these!”

He has absolute confidence in their preservative properties. Likewise in their nutrition and taste. Servants who have mastered an array of disciplines were involved in the making of these cans, so of course he would be confident in them.

Take them on your next trip, or maybe hold a canned food party this coming weekend.
