Valentine’s Day chocolate from Okita J. Souji.

Great, great, great victory for swimsuit Okita!!! As Okita has many victories under her belt stretching all the way back to the Bakumatsu period, there’s no way she will lose herself and get carried away just because she’s in a swimsuit!

And so, the merriest and klutziest captain of the swimsuit Shinsengumi used her jets to acquire the hottest product in the Universe: the Jet Chocolate Youkan. What exactly makes it “jet” is the Universe’s closely guarded secret, so the world may never know…but it’s damn tasty and there’s no denying that. The memory of the two of you flying through the azure sky during that one summer day is somehow in every bite of these chocolates.
