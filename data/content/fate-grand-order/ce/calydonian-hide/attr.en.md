Even though this was given to me as a Noble Phantasm, I didn’t understand WHY. I didn’t even know how to use it. In fact, I thought it might be a totem needed to curse someone.

…But now I know.
The moment I come face-to-face with someone I sincerely detest, someone I simply must beat… The moment I decide to let hatred consume me… That is when this hide becomes a Noble Phantasm.

I want to become a beast.
A beast that doesn’t feel anything…a being that only kills.
A beast that never has to feel the sorrow that constantly twists at my heart…
