The rod held by the man considered to be the progenitor of the art of medicine. He is said to have treated patients with a serpent by his side. Why he did this remains unclear. Was the snake just a pet? Or was it used in some sort of treatment? Or was the fact of its continuous molting meant to symbolize immortality for some manner of magecraft?

Obviously, none can explain the serpent entwined around the cane. Is it a living creature, or something artificial? Or could it be something derived from the Greek gods?

We asked him.

“Huh? That’s a pointless question. All patients have to do is to trust their doctor. Asking questions like, ’what is this medicine?’ and ’why are you doing that?’ is futile, even infuriating. It’s a waste of time, and it gets in the way of treatment. That’s why you just need to obediently… What’s that? A doctor is obliged to explain? Informed consent? The modern world sure has become annoying.”
