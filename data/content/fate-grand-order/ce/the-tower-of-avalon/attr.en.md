It is the final paradise, filled with flowers of every imaginable color.
In the day, it’s filled with the spring sunlight and the scent of summer, and at night, you feel the fall air and look up at the winter stars.
The earth is filled with flowers and insects. The forests with water and green and beasts.
Beautiful fairies dance near the waterside.
In the myths, this tiny little world is called the Land of Eternal Spring, or the Island of the Apple.
It is a utopia, far beyond the reach of animals who possess wisdom.

Its name is Avalon. The inner sea of the planet.
It is another name for the place where the Earth’s soul is kept.

The man sealed himself there.
He locked himself in the tower, and chose a future where he could not die until the end of the world.
He had seen what he needed to see.
…No.
It was because he’d seen more than enough beauty.

“Now go, Cath Palug. I will remain here.
You must be free, and go witness what is truly beautiful.”

The man felt nothing in particular as he let his last roommate out of the window.
The mage looked out his only window and over the world, without ever becoming tired of it.

This is a fairy tale of the end of the world, and there’s nothing more to it than that.
