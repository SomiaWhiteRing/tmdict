Within the moon’s imaginary world, there are people who live their daily lives.

As the anticipated evening arrives, two girls exchange trivial but pleasant conversation.

One acts in a childish way…
While the other seems a bit annoyed…
Yet both seem to be engaged happily.

It’s as if they had been itching to talk to each other for the longest time.
