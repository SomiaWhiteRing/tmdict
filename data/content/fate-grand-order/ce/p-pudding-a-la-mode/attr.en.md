Valentine’s chocolate from Passionlip.

Passion Pudding à la Mode.
A sweet dessert Lip prepared with help from Cat.
Lip created multiple tiny cubed chocolates and arranged them in the bowl, while Cat plated the rest of the ingredients. They put a cherry on top.

Giving Master chocolate is already a big deal to Lip, but preparing the chocolate with a friend is also a precious memory now.
