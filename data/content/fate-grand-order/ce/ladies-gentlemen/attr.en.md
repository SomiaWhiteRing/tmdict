The people’s wishes are all here.
It’s time to begin the greatest show!

Your guide is Napoleon, a man of possibilities, and a legendary dragon hunter. Outside, the self-proclaimed Flying General, more wacky and incomprehensible than Marengo, is able to swim due to his interpretation that the ocean is like the grasslands!!!

Now see here, a never-before-seen experience awaits you all!

After all, the word “impossible” doesn’t seem to exist in my dictionary!
