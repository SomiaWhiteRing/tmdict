Hello there, to you who dreams.
Look upon me with those young eyes.
The world is uncertain, yet the world is kind, everyone is a friend.
The clouds floating there in the sky look like candy!
Your sparkling eyes illuminate the world before you.

Goodbye there, to you who dreamt.
Look upon me with those old eyes.
The whole world is clear, yet the whole world is cruel, everyone has become tired like you.
Even candy has become tasteless!
The sparkling world is what awakens those eyes.

Wonderland is a land of fairy-tales.
Rhymes are the lullaby for dreams…
Not even worth one shilling.
Not guaranteed to last even ten years.
Eventually those sweet memories will fade.
But sweet pain is needed.

Even if you forget about the book, please don’t forget what was hidden between the pages.
