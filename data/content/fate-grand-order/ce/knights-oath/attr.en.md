He swore.
To uphold chivalry, to show loyalty to his king, to protect his loved ones with these two spears.

He never once thought of that oath as a lie.
Yet, when he realized and looked back on it, the path he walked had been tainted.
His friends had left long ago, and only his love remained at his side.
He loved his wife, dearly.
When his children were born, his heart trembled with happiness watching them grow.

But, sometimes he looked back on the path he walked.
And always, he’d see something fallen on the road.
Tainted, twisted, trampled underfoot.
The knight’s oath, shining so sadly bright.
